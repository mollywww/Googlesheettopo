I don't feel well enough.
I've already got a pet.
I can't place that from way up here.
It's too dangerous right now!
I don't want to change right now.
It can only handle one style change at a time.
I can't cook right now.
Looks like we had the same idea.
It's too far away!
This'd be easier if I had the item in front of me.
It was worth a shot.
I'll try again in a second.
It won't resurrect.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
We already know that one.
That doesn't go there.
Perhaps this is a bad idea.
A living log would probably be of more use.
A mushroom would probably be of more use.
It's not quite the right shape.
I'm not sticking that in there!
Not even science could make that into a sculpture.
It's not quite the right shape.
Too unconscious to care.
We already put something there.
This gem won't work here.
It's not put together right.
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Your pockets are too full!
Too unconscious to care.
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Your pockets are too full!
Too unconscious to care.
Someone beat me to the saddle!
I know better than to bother an angry beefalo!
I don't think that was right.
I can't do that.
They're elbow deep in junk right now.
It won't let me do that while it's angry.
I'm not going to try that while he's awake.
I can't shave that!
There isn't even any stubble left!
It's full.
I should wait my turn.
That can't go in there.
I can't learn that one.
I already know that one.
This map was made for some other place.
I'm a little preoccupied!!
Whoops! That wasn't right.
I need to have something to wrap.
I think it's fine as is.
There's only room for one scribbler.
I can't do that.
I feel so accomplished!
If only my friends could see me now...
That didn't go well. I'll have to try again.
The ground is destabilizing!
A tremor!
Terrible terralogical waves!
Allow me to pay tribute.
A tribute for you, great Antlion.
That'll appease it, for now...
I think it's time to leave!
What's that?!
It's not safe here.
oOooOooo!!
BEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!
Ow! I should try to catch that!
Yikes! That was hot!
\nI think I can fix this!
The ceiling is destabilizing!
That presence... it's familiar! Hello?
OW! Something bit me!
So cold!
This compass doesn't point anymore.
I'm missing a couple key ingredients.
Oh, H2O.
That sounded big!
It looks better already.
It's getting late. It will be dark soon.
Yum!
I can't eat that!
I don't feel so good.
Yuck! That was terrible!
I think that was starting to turn.
Putting that in my mouth would be disgusting!
Huff... Pant...
I should have built... a lifting machine...
Lift... with your back...
This isn't... gentleman's work...
For... science... oof!
Is this... messing up my hair?
Hngh...!
Pant... Pant...
This is the worst... experiment...
It's so dark!
I can see again!
My fan is gone with the wind.
I'm free! I'm finally free!
My humanity is about to start slipping away...
I feel so smart now!
Need... ice... or... shade!
Did you hear that?
I'm so hungry!
This track is fresh. The beast must be nearby.
The beast's trail ends here.
This wet soil can't hold a footprint.
Are you still hungry, plant?
I can't carry any more stuff!
It called for help!
There's no way to beat it now!!
Its chains came off!
Ugh, my head!
Safe from that frightening lightning!
I didn't learn very much from that.
Aaah! Bug off!
This beast seems to be wounded.
Now's not the time to flee this fight!
I can't open presents with monsters about!
It's too dangerous to siesta right now!
I'm too scared of dying to sleep right now!
It's too bright out.
I'm not tired.
I'm too hungry for a siesta!
I'm too hungry to sleep, my growling tummy will keep me up!
I should get off my beefalo first.
Night is for sleeping, not taking siestas.
I don't think I could really relax down here.
I don't exactly have a burning desire to sleep in that.
I can't change while it's on fire!
Well, that was easy.
Ow! Quit it!
Did I just hear trees screaming?
Uh, is it supposed to smell like that?
That doesn't sound good.
It's shielded!
Never stop learning!
Your majesty.
Your highness.
My liege!
All the monsters came back!
It didn't like that.
I guess I'm worthy.
Thanks for the protection from the elements, tree!
Sharp! Sharp bones!!
I've nearly reached my saturation point.
Ow!
It's been thuribly depleted.
The toad got away.
The toad is losing interest.
Wow, that tool is slippery!
My light just ran out!
I'm not sure that was science.
Oops.
OW! I don't think it's ready yet.
My clothes appear to be water permeable.
Water way to go!
That was not a sane thing to do.
Did you feel that?
Die, doe!
Go for the eyes!
Here piggy piggy!
I will destroy you!
I'm going to stomp you dead!
Better you than me!
I sure showed him!
I'll let him go. This time.
He's too fast!
He's too gross, anyway.
Shoo, you nasty thing!
Awww, she has a cute little bow.
It's hauntingly beautiful.
I'd die to find out what it does.
I don't think I should hang on to this.
It hurts my soul to look at that thing.
It's giving me the creeps.
Something is up with that flower!
I want to use it, and I want the world to know that I did.
There's definitely something inside there.
Roasted to perfection.
It'll be a tree soon!
I'm not sure I want to fall for that a second time.
I feel so safe when I get to wear it.
An ancient and mysterious structure.
This seems to be broken.
It seems to throb out of tune with the world.
Tracks left by food. I mean... an animal.
It wants something from me.
It looks mad.
I think we're on good terms.
Someone might be interested in this.
Hot mail!
Hopefully there aren't any bugs in it.
That looks really heavy.
It's oddly light.
No bones about it.
A soggy, sustaining, succulent suit.
It sticks to your back when you wear it.
That is a perfectly reasonable piece of clothing.
Wearing that makes me feel safe and insecure.
\"Don't play with matches.\"
It says \"Thataway\".
The sign is currently blank.
\"Don't play with matches.\"
It says \"Thataway\".
The sign is currently blank.
All that's left after the fire has done its job.
The eyebone was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
The flower was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
There's a perfectly scientific explanation for that.
It's gaining power.
It needs time to recover. Me too.
The gateway is destabilizing.
The essential components are still intact.
Back in working order.
There is power emanating from it.
Something must power it.
A truly unsettling light.
I don't recognize any of these symbols.
It depicts an old civilization. The people look hungry and scared.
This tablet is too worn to make out.
Something dark creeps over the city and its people.
The people are shedding their skins. They look different underneath.
It shows a massive, technologically advanced city.
It doesn't seem fully real.
A trusty axe.
Awwww. So cute!
Sweet dreams, smelly.
You could fit a whole lot of science in there.
The perfect breakfast for a man of science.
How are they floating?
It looks like clown currency.
Seems sterile enough.
That's too strong to break through!
Ack! That's terrifying!
I bet I could fly if I held two of them.
I don't want to wake them.
I hate those things, even when they're dead.
At least it's not coming back.
It's only gross when they're not your own.
What a bear of a badger.
Welcome to the hibernation station!
A mat of thick fur.
It's so warm and comfy.
Looks comfy, but it smells like mildew.
To bee or not to bee.
Careful!
How did it get burned?!!
It's full of honey.
Bees!
It's empty.
It's full of honey.
Need to wait a bit.
This one is slightly less smelly than the others.
He's coming along peacefully.
It's a beefalo!
Aww, he's so sad.
It looks deeply angry.
Hmmm, there may be too much food inside it.
This fellow appears quite ridable.
These guys are really heavy sleepers.
That's a case of hat-hair waiting to happen.
It smells like beefalo tears.
It's guarding the queen.
Protects your skin, but squashes your meticulous coiffure.
It's buzzing with activity.
It buzzes when shaken.
Bottled mosquito rage!
Keep that stinger away from me!
It's too sticky to walk on.
Was that there before?
How in science did it get so big?!
Beeswax is a scientifically proven preservative!
Dingalingaling.
That teddy bear is moving around. Interesting.
It finally fell apart.
It's all scorched.
Red berries taste the best.
I don't think heat improved them.
Extra tasty, though they won't last long.
Better eat them before they spoil!
I think it needs to be fertilized.
It's very much on fire.
It looks pretty sick.
Err, something's not right.
I think those are the edible kind.
Maybe they'll grow back?
Nothing will grow in this heat.
It won't make any berries in this state.
It's very much on fire.
It looks pretty sick.
Err, something's not right.
I should leave them there until it's time to eat.
The bush is working hard on the next batch.
The heat even dehydrated the juicy berries!
That is one biiig foot.
A mad little nut.
Maybe he's just resting?
Now it just needs a bird.
He's looking a bit peckish.
Who's a good bird?
That bird is definitely deceased.
Awwww, he's asleep.
Has no one fed you in awhile?
Gives me a net advantage!
A small, normal egg.
Sunny side yum!
Back off, preacherman!
Ow!
It's falling apart!
This seems fundamentally unsafe.
Good practice for my birthday cake!
Just don't breathe in.
It has shocking accuracy.
Cool as ice!
It sparkles with cold energy.
It's always smart to keep an eye out.
It's scientific!
It's REALLY scientific!
It's weird and gooey.
It's different now...
It's a mushroom.
It's sleeping.
I wonder if it will come back?
Boards.
Bits of bone.
A stew to put some meat on your bones.
No point studying when I can just wing it.
The beginning was dull, but got better near the end.
I see no farm in reading that.
Strange, it's just 500 pages of telegraph codes.
Someone'll get suckered into reading this.
Aerodynamical!
I bet the beefalo really like this.
For catching bugs.
Our supplies are in there!
Wrapping things up should make them easier to carry.
I am filled with an irresistible urge to do science.
It's all burnt up.
It's kind of scratchy.
I can't believe it's butter!
Butterfly, flutter by.
Now I have you!
We threw the recipe away and just kind of winged it.
Without these, it's just a butter.
What a bizarre buzzard!
Sharp but delicious.
Deflated, but still spiny.
A pretty flower from a prickly plant.
There are still some spines between me and a tasty meal.
Grilled fruit of the desert.
That fire needs more fuel or it's going to go out.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
The fire's getting a bit low.
Nice and comfy.
Well, that's over.
Some sort of yellow creature made of science.
I'm not squishing you, am I?
It's probably fine.
It's some sort of delicious pocket dimension for sugary treats.
Technically walking is just controlled falling.
Yuck. This vegetable came out of the dirt.
Mushy.
The earth is making plantbabies.
It's a carrot seed.
So much for that.
Nothing but ash now.
Now I can show everyone what I found!
A playful little thing.
Its owner ran out of lives.
It's a den in a stump.
Ears hat!
I think I can lift this one.
It's out of reach.
It's mushy.
Not my fault!
Yum!
It's dubiously photosynthetical.
I wonder if that rock could be moved.
I'll have to wait until someone leaves to enter.
The earth itself rejects me!
I bet there's all sorts of things to discover down there.
It's probably hiding something.
The surface is too crowded!
I'll just stay down here, I suppose.
I've had enough discovery for now.
It's a fern.
It's small, dark, and smells like burnt wood.
A pile of broken chess pieces.
Another pile of broken chess pieces.
Even more broken chess pieces.
It was a lot bigger up close.
It's a stone bishop.
The chess pieces are moving themselves!
It feels like its eye follows you.
Ah, that brings back memories. Bad ones.
Doesn't seem very \"kingly\" to me.
Makes my stomach rumble just looking at it.
It's a horse, of course.
The chess pieces are moving themselves!
Eurgh. It's so lifelike.
Hmm... Looks familiar.
I can relate.
That was never really my thing.
It's even heavier than it looks.
The chess pieces are moving themselves!
Otto von Chesterfield, Esq.
It's looking at me.
It went to sleep.
That fire needs more fuel or it's going to go out.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
The fire's getting a bit low.
Nice and comfy.
Well, that's over.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats darkness.
Good thing it's contained!
The fire's getting a bit low.
Nice and comfy.
At least I can start it up again.
East.
Which way am I facing?
North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
Poor little guy.
Charbroiled to perfection.
That's only somewhat more appetizing than when it was raw.
Now there's no reason to worry about getting worms!
The pot got cooked.
This is going to take a while.
It's almost done!
Mmmmm! It's ready to eat!
It makes me hungry just to look at it.
I think it's still swishing.
High in fructose!
Cooked and high in fructose!
It's a corn seed.
Is there something in there?
It's wyrmed its way into my heart.
What an aerodynamical creature!
You'd make a good lab assistant.
Much less mucusy than its momma.
My feathered friend.
Pretty cute for a lil monster!
Creepy!
He's not very happy in there.
Cut grass, ready for arts and crafts.
Nutritious, but it won't last long.
Cut reeds, ready for crafting and hobbying.
Seductively smooth.
A most potent dish.
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Take that, nature!
It's all leafy. Most of the time.
It looks unhappy about me stealing those birchnuts!
What an impressive antler!
Is it staring at me? ...No, I guess not.
It's enormous!!
This is really gross.
Was that supposed to come off?
It's being controlled by that beast!
It's probably a tuft of grass.
Quality eye protection.
It smells of bacon!
I'm not strong enough to wield it.
It's a pile of dirt... or IS it?
The signal is very faint.
It's some kind of homing device.
This thing's going crazy!
I'm headed in the right direction.
Must be getting pretty close.
I wonder what it does.
It looks like it needs a large key.
Now the machine can work!
That rod looks useful!
I'm middling on this middle piece.
That's one fly dragon!
Next best thing to a lockbox!
Produces a lot of heat, but not much light.
I don't think it's supposed to look like that.
It's scalding!
Is it winking at me?
What a weird fruit.
The fruit's still weird.
It's a weird fruit seed.
So who gets to be the head?
The dragonfruit is very filling.
Someone has to bring up the rear.
They're still warm.
Ready for gobbling.
Even better for gobbling!
Now it can be taken anywhere.
This could be replanted closer to home.
It can be planted anywhere now.
This needs to be planted.
This needs to be planted.
Oh, it smells!
Now it smells even worse!
It's a durian seed.
Makes you warm and fuzzy inside. Outside, too.
This will make a delicious meal.
Smells great!
It doesn't look like an egg.
It's even less eggy.
It's an eggplant seed.
A burnt vase on a burnt table.
I should put something in there.
It's nice to have a little light.
A flower in a vase on a table.
Did we remember to pick up new bulbs?
Not looking too fresh.
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Take that, nature!
It's all piney.
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Take that, nature!
This sad tree has no cones.
It watches over the wearer.
I think I'm being watched.
I hope it doesn't turn on me.
I think it's sleeping.
I don't think anything will grow in a pile of ash.
I should try planting some crops.
Go plants go!
I think it needs to be fertilized.
Down, to bring the temperature down.
BECOME THE BIRD!
The feather increases the scientific properties of the writing.
A canary feather.
A crow feather.
A redbird feather.
A snowbird feather.
She's trapped!
It's just a wood fence.
It opens. And closes sometimes, too.
All we need to build a nice, sturdy gate.
All we need to build a nice, sturdy fence.
That is definitely a bucket full of poop.
Filled with explosion science!
If only I could catch them!
They make my pocket glow!
That one is glowy.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats darkness.
Good thing it's contained!
The fire's getting a bit low.
Nice and comfy.
At least I can start it up again.
I don't want to set the world on fire.
The fuel tank is getting a bit low.
All quiet on the flinging front.
Fling on!
Now I shall eat for a day.
Hook, line and stick!
Sticks to your ribs.
Crunchy and delicious!
Grilled to perfection.
It's a very sharp rock.
It's pretty, but it smells like a common laborer.
To match my rosy cheeks.
It smells like prettiness.
A bowl of foliage.
Science makes it glow.
Augh! It's so evil!
I don't think it got enough sun.
Some leafy greens.
I don't like sports.
Science bones! We should put them back together.
It's alive! Oh wait, no, it's not.
My scientific instincts say this isn't quite right.
Still missing some pieces.
He's croaked.
He's so cute!
Aww, look at him sleep!
A very leggy sandwich.
I've heard it's a delicacy.
Tastes like chicken.
Fruity.
Black and white fur.
I don't like how it's looking at me.
It looks very lifelike.
A pile of mechanical parts.
It needs a gem.
Looks ready.
This offends me as a scientist.
Is that for me?
That's a wrap!
That's science for you.
Memories of the time I wasn't skewered.
It's cute, in a gross kind of way.
The petals droop and shimmer in the light.
The petals shimmer in the light.
This goop smells foul.
These would look empirically amazing on a helmet!
It's buzzing with tastiness!
What a stylish pair of goggles.
That's one fancy axe.
Hey, isn't gold really soft?
Why did I even make a pitchfork this fancy?
I can't wait to dig holes.
I can't eat it, but it sure is shiny.
Fluffy!
It needs poop.
That's burning fast!
It looks pretty sick.
Err, something's not right.
It's a tuft of grass.
It was cut down in the prime of its life.
It's not going to grow back while it's so hot.
It looks really sick.
It's an extra leafy lizard.
My hair looks good wet... it's when it dries that's the problem.
No base should be without one!
It's green and gemmy.
That'll keep a watchful eye on the place.
This will come in handy.
It seems pretty normal.
It's different now...
It's a mushroom.
It's sleeping.
I wonder if it will come back?
Avogadro's favorite dish.
Another flavor of poop.
It looks like pepper.
The cavities are probably worth it, right?
Only a sucker wouldn't love this.
Much better tasting than the real thing.
What corruption of science grew these?
It's... corn.
They wriggle on the way down.
My teeth are going to have something to say about this tomorrow.
I... don't think I'll be eating those.
Everyone'll be raisin' a fuss over these.
Only a sucker wouldn't love this.
Sticks to your teeth.
This seems unsanitary.
Stop! It's time! To hammer things!
It's not lab-safe!
The stinging means that it's working.
That's a cold stone.
It's colder than ice.
I could manipulate its temperature.
Nice and toasty hot!
It's quite warm and cuddly... for a rock!
The world seems less a little crazy when I wear it.
Someone must live here.
\"Don't play with matches.\"
It says \"You are here\".
The sign is currently blank.
Looks delicious!
Bees used to live in this.
Sweet and savory.
Tastes like chicken, but I don't think it is.
It sounds like a beefalo field in there.
Five alarm!
You ain't nothing, hound dog!
Creepy.
I've got no bones to pick with the owner. Really.
It's sharp!
Flesh is flesh. Where do I draw the line?
Cooked nice and pink, but still morally gray.
Letting it dry makes it not come from a human, right?
Hutch Danglefish, P.I.
I always wanted one of these.
Maybe he needs some science?
Ice to meet you.
I have harnessed the power of cold!
I scream for ice cream!
Stay cool, boy.
Are there hounds for every season?
The fur keeps the temperature inside stable.
It's cold to the touch.
TAKE THAT, SANE SELF!
It's more of a pyramid than an obelisk.
Am I still in one piece?
Probably should have made a jar.
One part jelly, one part bean.
Lunch on a stick.
Oh no! It's a killer bee!
This seems dangerous.
What on earth is that thing!
It's really fancy for a deer antler.
We should definitely open that.
Check it out!
It's a knightmare!
Adorably delicious.
It looks warm and full of meat.
He's going after my stuff!
Ew. It has Krampus slime all over it.
A more civilized light.
Too hot to handle.
Cooled off and chilled out.
There's a faint warmth coming from inside.
I don't think that egg is warm enough.
I never thought I would see a happy egg.
It seems happy.
Aww. Who's a good monster?
I hear a tiny stomach grumbling.
Poor thing must be starving.
It's an egg tooth!
I like to call it \"Basaliva\".
Hot spit!
Magmificent!
As gneiss a place as any.
He's huge!
He's huge!
Only a cyanobacteria could grow in this light.
A scientific breakthrough! The cure!
It's strangely tasty looking.
It's her lucky lighter.
I don't think it liked being struck by lightning.
\"Baaaah\" yourself!
It's like a miniature lightning rod.
The power is mine!
To harness the heavens!
He won't be cute and cuddly forever.
It looks worried.
Is it watching me?
That's some hot wood!
It's big, it's heavy, and it's wood.
What a lucky find!
That's a prettier axe than I'm used to.
How did this tree even reproduce?
It's so alluring.
Now I can start my very own meat farm.
He's trapped!
Mandrake roots have strange properties.
Well, he won't be waking up again.
Cut it out!
It doesn't seem so strange anymore.
I've heard strange things about those plants.
I feel a lil better when I hold one.
A blank map. Doesn't seem very useful.
Fancy!
I traded the old family cow for it.
It looks carved.
I think I could use that.
Makes sense to me.
I don't think an axe will cut it.
That's burning fast!
It looks thorny.
Ouch.
It's a plant.
Spikes and fire!
Now it's burnt and spiky.
Not so spiky now!
Those spikes look sharp!
I hate that guy.
I can see into his pores.
I wonder how they work.
Looks almost like a key hole.
So that's where the music was coming from.
That doesn't look very comfortable.
It's a bit gamey, but it'll do.
It's just a big wad of meat.
The rack got dried.
Jerky time!
Meat takes a while to dry.
Meat takes even longer to dry in rain.
I should dry some meats.
Just jerky enough.
Smells fishy!
Burnt merm flesh somehow smells even worse.
The stinkiest thing I'll smell all day.
Nothing to live in, now.
Who would live here?
It seems to be popular over there.
If I had any friends, this could take me to them.
If I step through, will I still be me?
A hands-free way to brighten your day.
Somehow the breeze comes out the back twice as fast.
I could draw better than that!
We should draw something on there.
It's not much use like this. We should place it.
That thing doesn't look happy.
It may contain a bigger something fantastic! Or horrible.
Wow! I'm glad that didn't gore me!
I'd sure like to whack that mole... thing.
Nowhere left to dig, my friend.
Something's under there, searching for minerals.
A wretched stench, but excellent visibility.
What a nice, homey hole in the ground!
Curious little guy.
Did that just move?
It's an affront to science.
Ugh. I don't think I should eat that.
Strange-smelling jerky.
It's all smashed up.
There's a hole in the middle for something to go in.
The stone lit it up somehow.
Now what?
I have a distinct feeling this isn't right.
There's no moon down here to measure.
Water amplifies the science, allowing us to measure the moon.
It's a full moon.
It's a new moon.
The moon is waning.
The moon is waxing.
I should stick something shiny in it. For research.
That rock came from the moon.
I could probably break that.
I don't exactly know what that thing is.
The babies are like excited electrons trying to escape.
It puts its babies there.
Disgusting little bloodsucker.
Hey, is that my blood?
It's probably someone else's blood...
Aaah! You are definitely not an electron!
He probably deserved it.
I bet there's all sorts of good stuff down there!
This ought to be a scientific impossibility.
It's brilliant!
A mushroom cloud in the making!
Makes the wearer look like a fun guy.
How im-morel!
How scientific!
The power of science compelled it.
It could use a spore. Or a mushroom transplant.
The mushrooms have really taken to the log.
The log is dead. We should replace it with a live one.
I don't think it can grow in this cold.
It should keep growing now.
That's a lot of mushrooms!
Comboletely burnt.
It's a big, science-y 'shroom.
Science makes it light up.
I didn't mildew it, I swear.
We could make a prime light source with some primary colors.
Blue is obviously the most scientific color.
I'm mildly offended by this.
These used to grow in my bathroom.
It's trying to reproduce.
A magic mushroom?
You can't tell from far away, but it's quite smelly.
That mushroom got too big for its own good.
The spiders thought this one was important.
It gives off a spooky light.
This stuff is crazy!
I wonder what function this served.
All is well.
The nightmare is almost gone!
There's no magic around here.
It seems to be staying steady.
Feels like it's receding.
Getting pretty magical around here.
It's becoming more concentrated!
It's electric!
Why would anyone make this? It's terrifying.
I'm not a geologist.
Is that a mirage?
We should add a beefalo bell.
This gem seems special.
It's scientifically proven that gems look better on top of sticks.
Teleportation can be so useful.
It's an orange gem.
No one could get lost with that thing looking out for them.
This beats walking.
It may contain something fantastic! Or horrible.
To serenade the animals.
Some sheets of paper.
Must be breeding season.
Stupid bird! Stay away from those berries!
It's inordinately large.
That won't do at all.
I've got to plant something there.
I feel like it wants something.
These turned out pretty good.
Sure showed those flowers who's boss!
I'm not sure I want to hold those.
It looks scared stiff.
It's thick and pliable. And salty.
Iconic, isn't it?
He doesn't look as friendly as the others.
This little piggy's gone... \"home\".
Crispy.
Looks like an offering to the beast.
Not so fancy now, pig!
I can see a snout pressed up against the window.
These pigs have pretty fancy houses.
Come ON! I know you're home!
Ewwww, he smells!
Someone should tell its family.
You're part of my entourage.
They kind of creep me out.
Looks serious.
Not a friendly pig!!
It still has the tail on it.
Smells like bacon.
Sure looks cozy.
I can hear a tiny tree inside it, trying to get out.
It'll be a tree soon!
Now I just need an angry mob to join.
That doesn't look very appealing.
At least it's warm now.
Leafy!
Guh! It's growing so slowly!
Mmmm. Ready to harvest.
The heat killed it.
%s looks shifty...
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
Greetings, %s!
%s could use a heart.
Murderer!
%s, friend of ghosts.
It looks like the inside of an alien's brain.
Haute Cuisine!
It's a pome-whatsit seed.
I can't see the bottom!
Some algae by a pond.
I should fill my pockets!
A fern in a pot.
Science help us.
It's as big as my head!
That's a pretty gourd cookie!
How did it not turn into a pie?
Spooky!
It's a pumpkin seed.
It's whispering to me.
It contains the mysteries of the universe.
Makes a good marker, but I wish it'd stop looking at me.
He's looking for carrots.
Do you like science?
That must lead to the Kingdom of the Bunnymen.
The Kingdom of the Bunnymen is closed for the season.
That's not a real roasted carrot.
That's not a real carrot.
Keeps the rain where it ought to be. Outside your body.
Messy hair... the terrible price of dryness.
The measuring parts went up in a cloud of smoke.
It measures cloudiness.
An excellent source of fiber.
A sharpened rock tied to a stick. For hygiene!
It sparkles with inner warmth.
This lantern feels more special than the others.
It can see and be seen for miles!
Is there something inside that?
It smells funny.
It's different now...
It's a mushroom.
It's sleeping.
I wonder if it will come back?
That's really burning!
It's a clump of reeds.
All the useful reeds have already been picked.
Keep off, evil sun!
Ancient household goods.
It won't be doing much science now.
It breaks down objects into their scientific components.
The extra science didn't keep it alive.
It's even more science-y than the last one!
Whatever it was, it's burnt now.
What have I created?
Fire doesn't really solve naming issues...
Who would name something that?
Not much use anymore.
What a handsome devil!
It's always a good idea to touch base.
The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!
Does that mean winter is gone?
He likes my pocket.
Life in the frozen wastes.
It's so soft.
They're trapped!
It wouldn't fit in my pocket.
We could make stuff with these.
It has terrifying claws.
Ice to meet you.
Won't be useful until it freezes again.
Won't be useful until it freezes again.
A crusted over lava pit.
The lava's crusting over.
Nice and comfy.
Looks fragile.
That rock came from the moon.
It looks scared stiff.
It looks scared stiff.
Storm the castle!
Terrifying!
Some short lengths of rope.
Ew! It stinks!
It infuses the eater with the power of science!
Just bits and pieces of rock.
How's my hair?
It has quite a heft to it.
This can be fixed.
I hear whispers. It wants something.
It's passing its judgment.
This could take a saddle off.
That'll allow the mounting of some smelly animal.
This saddle really flies!
The only problem is the saddle sores.
How many licks does it take to get to the center?
It's so gritty!
I could've been skewered!
That's a CRAZY looking rock!
Where did the rest of it go?
That's burning fast!
It looks pretty sick.
Err, something's not right.
Baby trees are so cute!
That'll teach him.
It might be okay if it cooled down.
Someone made that strawman eat crow.
Someone MURDERed that scarecrow!
All dressed up and no where to crow.
Spooky.
Ready for sculpting.
Burnt right down.
We can make stone sculptures with this.
A masterpiece!
It looks old, but it feels new.
Now what?
Something's moving inside.
There's a big piece missing.
Is that a head?
It's an odd marble statue.
At least it's back in one piece now.
Something's moving inside.
I guess he cracked under the pressure.
Where's the rest of it?
It's some sort of marble statue.
All patched up.
Something's moving inside.
It's not in the best shape.
Where did this come from?
Each one is a tiny mystery.
That cooked the life right out of 'em!
That's an entirely scientific mapping tool.
Darn it! Darn it all to heck!
Good for mending.
Oh good. Now there's more of him.
The power of science must have reanimated it...
There's a lot going on underground.
Warts and all!
It won't provide much shade now.
A nice place for an afternoon rest, safely out of the heat.
It comes from a spider's butt.
Better you than me.
It gives me terrible visions.
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
A picture of a sculpture. We'll need somewhere to make it.
I'm not sure if I want to open it.
It makes snooze circles when I throw it.
It's so hairy!
Doesn't look all that much different dead.
Doesn't look all that much different dead.
Ew. Just ew.
That would mess up my hair.
A den of \"ew\".
If it wasn't useful, I wouldn't touch it.
A puzzle with no solution.
That's a rather small bird.
It looks hungry.
It must be starving.
A tiny chunk of dead animal.
A little jerky.
He's less gross, but still gross.
What a crusty looking animal.
That's one pointy stick.
It feels very stabby.
Ewwww!
I hate spiders.
I'd better not be here when he wakes up.
Sticky!
I hope these don't hatch. Period.
It has a tangy, antiseptic smell.
I hope I got all of the spider goo out of it.
It's encrusted with old webbing.
It's encrusted with old webbing.
AHHHHHHHH! That spider is huge!
Note to self: Don't look up.
Gah! More spiders!
I hate spiders!
Good riddance!
Looks even meaner than usual.
I should keep my distance.
It's a furry ball of rotten food.
Hasn't a care in the world.
I'll keep a little light in my pocket.
That's a sight for spore eyes.
I'll keep a little light in my pocket.
It's just drifting around.
I'll keep a little light in my pocket.
Brr! Chilling.
That seems really dangerous.
Spinning doom.
Just keep your hand to yourself, alright?
Something's odd here, but I can't put my finger on it.
Looks like a rock to me.
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks...
The skeleton fused with the shadows!
Why'd it have to be so big?
Anklebiters!
I broke it. For science.
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be.
What happened to the head?
He's a lot shorter in person.
It's a fancy marble statue.
Don't lose your head now!
Statuesque.
Scratchy metal fibers.
Looks sharp!
Hats always ruin my hair.
It's really stuffing!
I could eat that, but I'd rather not.
Aloe there.
A succulent in a pot.
This vest is dapper as all get-out.
If I had a dentist they'd be mad I ate stuff like that.
That's a tall bird!
Will it hatch?
Delicious and nutritious.
Is it shivering or am I?
Looks like it's hatching!
Are eggs supposed to sweat?
I have a feeling this is going to take a while...
It should hatch any time now.
That's quite an egg!
The nest is empty.
Not a very tall bird.
You need some food and quick, huh?
It has a dangerous look in its eye.
It needs more purple gems.
It's ready to go.
With this I can surely pass through space and time!
This appears to be a nexus to another world!
There's still something missing.
Soon, the invention will be complete!
This may control the polarity of the whole universe.
Tough enough to handle the most intense experiments.
This metal potato contains great and fearful power...
A ring that could focus dimensional energies.
That could reveal the world.
Nothing left to sleep in.
I get sort of crazy when I don't sleep.
That looks dangerous.
It's pointy and slimy.
I think these were its genitalia.
Yet another slimy pole.
A slimy pole.
Little slippery arms.
Seems stinky, but worth exploring.
I wonder where this is from?
It's some smaller chunks of Thulecite.
It smells like chemicals.
Yeesh! I'm not kissing that!
He's hopping mad now!
Just a hole in the ground.
That toadstool's just asking to be cut down.
There's something poking out.
What a nice hat.
Something to hold back the night.
Ready for departiculation.
This pyramid controls the sands.
A more sane person would walk.
A mini departiculator.
A healthy, natural snack.
It's whirring with electricity.
I wove it real tight.
This is a nasty surprise.
I'll want to avoid stepping on that!
That trunk was truncated.
It's a tickle trunk!
How convenient!
It's almost like someone is trying to prevent me from going somewhere.
Melted. Maybe Willow had some fun with them?
They've quickly become Wes' favorite prop.
Hal whispers beautiful lies to me.
That's just asking to be experimented on.
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Now if I only had some tea...
...Maxwell left his stuff out again.
...Maxwell left his stuff out again.
A horrifying utensil fusion. Maybe science *can* go too far.
I wonder what it's hiding?
It doesn't spin very well.
What's kazoo with you?
Wigfrid keeps jumping out and hitting me with it?!
This egg beater is all bent out of shape.
I have a few theories about this string.
I can put my shoes on without help, thanks.
I think Wickerbottom had a cat.
It smells kind of stale.
Food and a cup! The ultimate survival container.
If you unwound it you could poke someone from really far away.
How Machiavellian.
How Machiavellian.
The knot is stuck. Forever.
Honestly, he just leaves them out wherever.
Honestly, he just leaves them out wherever.
I know someone who'd have a ball with this!
I hope this doesn't attract spiders.
Let's make a wish. For science.
Hard to find a good flask around here.
I might need these after all that candy.
I don't believe in the supernatural.
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Sadly it's too small for me to escape on.
Their electricity carrying days are over.
There's no time for fun and games!
Great. All of my tub stopping needs are met.
I'm more of a zipper person, myself.
Wilderness casual.
Winter survival gear.
Somehow even more nasal than before.
A light breezy trunk.
A thick, hairy trunk.
Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up.
Yet another ground type.
It's surprisingly scratchy.
Yet another ground type.
These are pretty snazzy.
Yet another ground type.
A chunk of ground.
A chunk of ground.
Do you want proof that it's fireproof?
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
A chunk of ground.
A chunk of ground.
A chunk of ground.
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
Hastily cobbled stones.
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
Yet another ground type.
These are floorboards.
Mmmm.
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Take that, nature!
It looks sick. More so than usual.
It's all stick-y.
There's a stick-y tree inside it that wants to get out.
It doesn't need any help to grow.
That tree looks pretty wimpy.
It's a bunch of small twigs.
I always hate when my hair gets wet and poofy.
I hope this doesn't make anyone eel!
It doesn't look finished! It could be dangerous.
I'm waffling on whether it needs more syrup.
That won't do at all.
Hmmmm. I guess that'll have to do.
This seems like a bad idea.
Spacey and smooth!
Very light, but surprisingly tough.
An ancient piece of wall.
A solid piece of history.
That's a nice wall.
They make me feel so safe.
Burnt!
Pointy!
Pickets!
Walruses are natural predators.
It's covered with walrus hairs.
Looks like somebody was camping here.
It looks warm and cozy inside.
I'm sure I'll find a use for it eventually.
That's burning fast!
It's outta style now.
It holds dark, forbidden secrets...
You might be something to reckon with, big dog.
I think those bees are mad.
What a scientific marvel!
Sticky sweet.
Let the juice run down your face.
Cryogenic watermelon.
Juicy and warm.
It's a melon seed.
I'd like to avoid a punch from %s, if possible.
%s is really heating things up today.
Good day, %s!
Nice try. You're not escaping to Valhalla yet, %s.
%s's gone berserk!
%s has full command of spirits.
Pretty fancy hat, that.
Some sheets of wax paper.
Seems you've gone from \"dapper\" to \"slapper\".
%s's just asking to get roasted.
Decent day to you, %s!
Don't look at me like that, %s! I'm working on it!
I'll show you Logic and Reason... those're my fists!
%s is using his powers for good.
Spooky.
I'm gonna roll up a piece of papyrus newspaper, just in case.
We need to have a group meeting about fire safety.
Good day, %s!
%s is really buggin' me for a heart.
Murderer! I'll squash you, %s!
%s is playing well with others.
Poor little guy. He deserves a proper funeral.
%s doesn't have any sharp objects, does she?
I know you set those flames, %s.
Greetings, %s!
I'm seeing double! I'd better concoct a heart for %s.
Murderer!
%s treats ghosts like family.
%s is silent, but deadly...
Wait, don't tell me. You lit a fire.
Greetings, %s!
How do you say \"I'll conduct a revival device\" in mime?
Mime this!
%s thinks outside the invisible box.
It tastes like nothing.
I hope it dries off soon.
This package is barely holding together.
Nothing like loud noises to help keep the peace.
I think %s's planning to throw the book at me.
I'm sure you had a very clever reason for that fire.
Good day, %s!
This doesn't seem very scientific, does it, %s?
Here comes my peer review!
I have deep respect for %s's practical theorems.
%s is holding that lighter pretty tightly...
Again?
Good day to you, %s!
I bet you're just burning for a heart, %s.
Murderer! Arsonist!
%s, friend of ghosts.
Yeesh. Do I always look that creepy?
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
Stars and atoms! Are you my doppelganger, %s?
Better concoct a revival device. Can't leave another man of science floating.
Your existence is an affront to the laws of science, %s!
%s has expertly put our theories into practice.
It'll be good for when winter comes.
Its measuring days are over.
Mercurial.
The anatomy's not right, but I'll overlook it.
I'm going to eat forty. For science.
A Yuletide toothache waiting to happen.
That experiment may have been a tiny bit unethical.
It's nice to eat something other than berries for once.
I'm puddin' that straight in my mouth!
It's a hollowed apple filled with yummy juice.
How does it stay warm? A thermodynamical mug?
Can science explain why it tastes so good?
Every scientist appreciates a good bauble.
This one is especially impressive.
A tree's not complete without some electricity.
That was a mistake, I think.
That puts a damper on the festivities.
Happy Winter's Feast!
It's almost Winter's Feast!
That puts a damper on the festivities.
I need a pine cone for that.
Let's not start a fight with the strongman...
You can't actually \"fight\" fire, %s!
It's good to see you, %s!
I told you you couldn't deadlift that boulder, %s. The numbers were all wrong.
Murderer! I can take you!
%s is just a big teddy bear.
%s has been a bit of a sap lately...
%s's gone on a wood chucking rampage!
Will you bea-very mad if I don't revive you, %s?
Don't burn yourself out, %s.
Greetings, %s!
Does \"universal\" coverage include the void, %s?
Murder! Bring me an axe and we'll get in the swing of things!
%s saved everyone's backbacon.
Just looks like a pile of dirt.
Seems safe to me.
It's a worm!
Soft and undulating.
Science compels me to jump in.
Guh, that thing looks worse off than usual.
Looks delicious.
Kinda wrinkled.
Seems safe to me.
I think we need to tweak your primary directive, %s...
You look like you're gonna melt, %s. What happened?
Good day to you, %s!
I always thought %s could use a heart. Now I'm certain!
%s! You've violated the first law!
I guess %s got that empathy module up and running.
Warm to the touch.
This gem is yellow.
That ought to show everyone the way.
A genius invention... a gem on a stick.
It's a... thing.
That thing is about to catch fire.
It's too dark to see!
Mmm. Beaky.
Alas, I am too stricken.
I can only command one beastie!
I must first dismount from my mighty steed.
Gasp! My furs!
That's where I keep all my favorite furs and pelts.
I shall let them select their garments first.
Alas! Bested by cookware!
I shall wait whilst my allies plan their feast.
I must close the gap between us!
The muses will not visit me if I do not place an item first.
The girl's spirit cannot be returned.
I'll try once more when it's done.
T'will not raise from death, it seems.
They'll have better things in Valhalla.
We have already conquered this knowledge.
T'will not work.
The spirit cannot be returned.
The sprite home requires sprucing up. With magical spruce!
Forest sprites have no need of that.
This object is not blessed with the power of the gods.
That material is not befitting a work of art.
The gods may frown were I to do that.
Such sweet slumber... Maybe later.
One material at a time!
This gem was not chosen for this purpose.
We must rearrange the bones of the beast.
I'll try once more when they're free.
They'll have better things in Valhalla.
They're not strong enough to carry more!
Such sweet slumber graces thy face... Maybe later.
I'll try once more when they're free.
They'll have better things in Valhalla.
They're not strong enough to carry more!
Such sweet slumber graces thy face... Maybe later.
I'll need to be faster than that in battle!
I'll only ride it if it's the victor.
It will not stay in place!
That is not a job for a warrior!
True warriors wait their turn.
I'll only ride it if it's the victor.
Let him sleep. Then I'll prune him.
Unshaveworthy.
But there's nothing to trim!
It is already brimming with goods.
My stalwart companion currently has use of that.
I fear that does not go there.
That knowledge is forbidden by the gods.
I already wield such knowledge.
This map is for some distant land...
Not when there is battle to be won!
The true key must be out there somewhere.
I cannot wrap that which does not exist!
I fear I cannot!
I shall valiantly wait my turn.
If I can't do it, it can't be done!
May I return to battle now?
Victory! Alright, let us away.
Back to the Otherworld, victory shall be mine!
The earth rebels against us!
Tis the footsteps of a giant!
What plagues you, mother Gaia?
A gift, that you may not devour us.
A tribute for thee, great lion!
O great lion, we pay tribute this day!
The beasts shalt soon reemerge!
The gods are angered!
There is danger on the wind!
oOooOOOo!!
Back, wee speared creatures!
Urg! I must master the curved weapon.
By Hel's fire!
\nI can repair this.
Rocks shall rain from on high!
Show yourself!
Coward!
Brrr! Where are my furs!
I fear I'm going to lose my way!
I lack the provisions.
Slick for battle.
A worthy foe approaches.
Be banished, beastly blight!
The sun is setting, darkness waits nearby.
Meat makes my heart sing!
This is not food befitting a warrior.
Ohh, I don't feel well.
Ugh, fresh is better.
That was stale beast.
This food is not befitting a warrior.
Hff... Nothing can weigh a warrior down!
Huff... Huff...
Tis... nothing...
Heave... ho...!
Gnnngh...
Swift... as Sleipnir...
Strong... like Thor...
Enduring... like Freya...
And the curtain falls.
I step into the light!
I've lost another fan!
Freedom! The saga continues!
They're driving me mad...!
I am an excellent craftswoman.
The hot sun tires me.
The beasts are approaching...
How I long for a feast!
Hush... The creature is near.
I've lost the tracks.
It's too muddy for trailing.
More droppings for you?
I'm carrying all I can!
Call thy hordes, they shan't protect thee!
RUN AWAY!
Now the true battle begins!
Ugh, my head.
I rode in on a bolt lightning.
That wasn't very exciting.
Away, tiny demons!
Don't give up, beast! Fight!
Only a coward would leave now!
Not with the gift of battle before me!
Battle is upon us, there'll be no rest!
It's not safe to sleep. Use the spear!
The sun is high, journey on!
I'll not rest yet.
I'd like a meat snack first.
I'll starve overnight! Feast first.
I must dismount my mighty steed!
No napping in the moonlight.
This doesn't feel like the time for a nap.
I'll not sleep in the flames.
I fear I cannot. It is being razed.
Thankfully, I am light of foot.
Away, feisty beaker!
I sense Loki's mischievous hand in the shadows.
Foul!
The world shudders!
Foul magics block mine blows!
The power of knowledge is great.
I will fight my way out!
Alas! I am unworthy!
I have gained the gods' favor!
Aha! Shelter!
No cage can hold me!
I'm nearly drowned!
Arg, I've been poked!
Alas, it is no more.
The beast returned from whence it came.
Don't let the beast entertain thoughts of escape.
Slippery devil!
My light is quenched!
Fear not! I have arrived!
That wasn't part of the plan.
It is not of this world.
I am a wet warrior.
Does this count as a bath?
That was a sloppy adventure.
The earth quakes with the approach of a foe!
I shall send you to the unicorn!
Valhalla awaits!
I'm having pig tonight!
Die bravely, little foe!
Spider, meet my spear!
Prepare to be slain!
Odin will have you yet!
I'll be back, pigskin!
I let you go this time!
Leggy coward.
Flee, monster! I will return.
What do you desire, apparition?
For me?
What is it waiting for?!
Perhaps it's best we part ways...
For me?
What is it doing?
Something wicked this way comes.
My victories shall be remembered!
There's a tree hiding within.
The young tree has been cooked.
Grow strong, young twigs!
Adventure is calling.
It's red, and a fighter. Just like me!
These crafts had better be good.
This one is not in working order.
Treasure with a mysterious aura.
Oh! I love a good hunt.
Tis the mighty lion!
We've incurred its wrath!
The lion smiles upon us.
A fitting tribute!
Excellent armor for the heat of battle.
Grass protection. That's not going to last long.
Near impenetrable!
Armor fit for Odin himself!
What devilish armor!
She ebbs the ache of hunger. Good fur.
A shield of sorts.
A borrowed tree vest.
Strong, but such a headache it gives...
Signs of a battle past.
A most well placed sign.
I shall point the way to triumph!
Signs of a battle past.
A most well placed sign.
I shall point the way to triumph!
The flames' remains.
The eyebone could not pass to this world.
The flower must remain in its home world.
It's burnt. Gone.
Soon it will open the path!
It shan't work again for some time.
Trickery! The Bifrost was of Loki!
Tis the Bifrost!
A light to guide the way!
Heimdallr's key to the Bifrost.
An ancient basin to house flames.
An unholy flame.
The writings of the gods t'were not meant for us.
Tis a portrait of an ancient people. They live in wretchedness.
There is no painting here. Only stone.
A great evil sweeps across the land.
Many of the people are cleaved in two!
A glittering city, blessed by the gods.
I doth smell their fear!
To chop and destroy!
Mini beastie.
The mini beast slumbers.
A portable armory.
Pig and eggs!
Fie! Foul beast!
Such colors! I could sing!
To heal even the deepest of battle wounds.
A thousand mortals couldn't break through this stone.
Dark winged meat.
Winged spear!
They're hiding under the stage.
Like the wings of my helm, only meatier.
Cooked dark wing.
Fur of the crazies.
Beast or berserker?
BEAR-SERKER!
It fought bravely, but its hide is now forfeit.
A luxury fur bed!
A tool for valiant naps.
Wee warriors! I don't know if I like them.
Easy now!
The hive is silent.
It's a honey treasure trove!
A sweet box of wee warriors.
Where's the honey?
It's a honey treasure trove!
Pithy honey. More patience is needed.
The critter has finally learned its role.
Come along beastie.
Ancient woolen beasts!
Are you cold without your wools?
The noble steed of a mighty warrior!
My mouth's watering just looking at it...
With the stalwart beast at my side, we ride tonight!
Sounds like Aunt Hilda.
That would suit me.
I do love woolly things.
En guarde!
A bee helm, of course.
Always buzzing, always plotting.
It sounds suspicious.
Watch your step!
Your monarchy shall topple this day!
A land not of milk, but of honey.
The bees are expanding their domain.
A hive of winged warriors.
The stuff of candlemakers.
I prefer the ringing resonance of clashing blades.
What a brave bear!
He has gone to Valhalla.
It's a stuffed bear.
Fruits. I don't like 'em.
Warm red mush.
I'd prefer a juicy steak.
You're not meat.
Should we put some turds on it?
Consumed by passionate flame!
Disease festers within its soul.
It is weakening before mine eyes!
A fruit bush.
The fruits have been snatched.
It's too hot to grow.
Good.
Consumed by passionate flame!
Disease festers within its soul.
It is weakening before mine eyes!
It's covered in rabbit food.
The rabbit food is all gone.
It looks atrocious.
That's something completely different!
A young tree warrior!
You can feast in Valhalla now, friend.
A home for my ravens!
What do you want, little friend?
Are you having a nice time?
The cage is soiled.
Sweet dreams, raven friend.
The raven wishes to feast!
I'm a cunning raven catcher!
Eggy.
Hot egg.
This one needs a good smack.
Rrraugh!
Be wary of his blasts!
Like the breath of a dragon.
Projectile weaponry!
Goodnight to our foes.
A face-to-face fight would be more honorable.
Cold jewelery.
An icy blue sapphire.
Odin's eye!
Oh, a map! No, wait. That's wrong.
Tis a blessed scroll.
Hmm, a blue one.
I have no desire to eat it.
It's mold, really.
Good, it's hiding.
I hope it doesn't grow again.
Grandfather logs.
Is that how I got here?
Bits of our enemies.
Delicious!
To rule the skies!
This tome is brimming with Hel's fire!
But can it tend the garden of mine soul?
Where's the drama? The suspense?
Knowledge grants great power!
For flinging at foes!
Time for hair and makeup!
To snatch insects from the air.
Ready to take on an epic saga.
That's a wrap.
I want to eat you.
Razed to the ground.
For the hunt.
Butter. Might it be good on steak?
It is sort of nice.
Caught!
Muffin, smuffin.
A pretty souvenir.
You and I, we meat feast together.
It does have admirable armor.
It will return.
Beauty from brawn.
Sword plant meat.
Toasted sword plant meat.
That fire's nearly dead.
Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
The fire roars!
Fire's slowly dying.
Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
And the light flickers out.
Oh sweet songbird, sing me thy tune!
Freedom has been wrenched from thy grasp by mine own.
What plague has besieged this innocent woodland creature?
That we might carry our sweetest plunders!
Turns \"walk\" to \"trot\".
Where's the protein?
Sad cooked carrots.
A wee root vegetable.
Tiny nature bits.
Alas! My hunting excursions will go unregaled!
I've no choice but to act out my directions now.
What legends might I find within these maps?
Oh! Cute meat with fur.
She fought bravely. Alas, she is gone.
Cute meat lives there.
A furry cap! Blessings to you, cute meat.
A feat of strength in the making.
I will clear the way!
Monkey food.
Thoroughly vanquished.
Warmed monkey food.
A flimsy monkey tree.
What treasures lie beneath?
It's more packed than the Thingvellir!
I've no desire to visit Hel today.
To the underworld!
What treasures lie beneath?
There are too many people up there.
I've had enough of Sol's shining face for one day.
Back to open skies!
Foliage from the dark ages.
Loot from Loge, the demigod.
It's only a pile of fallen warriors.
More fallen mechanical warriors.
Someone should really clean this place up.
Twas a battle to sing of.
This warrior does battle in the mind.
Battle is nigh!
Our fight shall be made ballad.
Tis the trophy of glorious battle!
Not a man fit for battle.
Feasts, feasts, everywhere, and not a ham to eat.
The figure of a fellow warrior!
Battle is nigh!
Twas an honor to fight thee.
A Valkyrie's spirit dwells within.
Tis a noble foot soldier.
Tis but a jest.
A castle fit for a queen.
Battle is nigh!
Don't worry, I won't eat him.
Who are you?
The eyeball is tired.
That fire's nearly dead.
A cold comfort.
The fire roars!
Fire's slowly dying.
A cold comfort.
And the light flickers out.
That fire's nearly dead.
A cold comfort.
The fire roars!
Fire's slowly dying.
A cold comfort.
And the light flickers out.
East.
A reading cannot be gleaned.
North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
She's definitely dead.
Meeeat!
Monster beast steak.
Yum, yum, meat snacks.
The fire reigned supreme.
Might as well do something whilst I wait.
Shouldn't be long now!
What have we here?
Nothing in there.
It is the tail of cute meat.
A vegetable sword!
Popped corn smells good.
Tiny nature bits.
Tis a peculiar boulder.
By the unicorn! A dragon!
A warrior's faithful companion!
She is a magnificent hunter!
I wouldst turn farmer for thee.
Not a raven, but wise nonetheless.
I shall defend this hound to the death.
Raven friend!
Together again.
A craftwoman's most elemental resource.
Even if I ate plants, I wouldn't eat THAT plant.
I cleaned all the bugs out! Then I ate them.
Solid stone!
A most potent dish.
The wood's ablaze!
Loge took that one.
Chopped by the warrior of the woods!
Future firewood!
This firewood will take a bit of extra work.
Skadi has bestowed a gift on Freya's creature.
The beauty of Freya dwells in all creatures!
Rays will shine through my spear and poke out your eyeball!
Delicious! I should like to share it with my new allies.
The unicorn's horn, in the flesh!
Tis a magical woodland creature!
It's probably a tuft of grass.
Tis no helm.
It smells of bacon!
I'm not strong enough to wield it.
A small hill of earth.
All is quiet.
A mechanical hunting hound. For the hunt.
Sound the horns! We've arrived!
We've got the scent!
The hound is excited. We're getting close.
What cryptic ruins.
Seems it's missing a piece...
Ready! The saga continues!
This mysterious sword feels important.
It's the beast's back.
Ah, dragon! At last we meet!
This chest is worthy of my weapons.
It retains the heat of the fallen beast.
It has seen much battle.
Its belly is alight with fearsome dragonfire.
A small inferno burns within.
It's very fancy.
Grilled fancy fruit.
Tiny nature bits.
The head of a great and merciful beast!
Why isn't this a meat pie? Meat, meeeat!
A beast is no beast without a tail.
Mystical scales.
Leg of beastie.
Hooooot meat!
I should like to see that returned to the earth goddess.
I should like to see that returned to the earth goddess.
I should like to see that returned to the earth goddess.
I should like to see that returned to the earth goddess.
I should like to see that returned to the earth goddess.
Smells like my battle boots.
What was the purpose of cooking this?
Tiny nature bits.
Yes, most practical!
Delicious slimy snake fish.
Hot eel!
Purple and bulbous.
Food for the weak.
Tiny nature bits.
It was no challenge at all.
There is no beast beneath.
The light burns bright.
Tis a tribute to Freya's beauty.
The light wanes.
Their beauty fades.
The wood's ablaze!
Loge took that one.
Chopped by the warrior of the woods!
I feel at home in the woods.
The wood's ablaze!
Loge took that one.
Chopped by the warrior of the woods!
A good sturdy tree.
Don't get rain in your eye!
Don't point your eyeball at me, foliage!
The eye of the laser god stares into my soul.
An ancient eyeball of protection!
Serves you right for not growing meats!
I can't grow meat, what's the point?
They're growing stronger.
It wants a turd feast.
The luxuries of camp, on the go.
Seems a bit flashy for battle.
Perhaps I'll pen a saga of my journeys!
In remembrance of a songbird.
A token from the ravens!
Red as my hair.
Winter's feather.
She looks unhappy upon her throne.
Tis not my kind of fencing.
A tiny replica of Valhalla's gates.
Not for fortification. Merely the farm.
Not for fortification. Merely the farm.
Its stench could raise the fallen.
To strike fear into the hearts of mine enemies!
Tiny fairy lights aglow!
I hold the light!
The flamed one has no mercy.
That fire's nearly dead.
Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
The fire roars!
Fire's slowly dying.
Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
And the light flickers out.
That we might become Masters of Fire!
The catapult grows weak and tired.
Time to rest, flinging warrior.
Catapult engaged for battle!
Meat of the sea!
I'm a ruthless fisherwoman.
Spears of sea meat.
Fish in a blanket!
Joy!
Vital for spear construction.
A flower from Freya.
Were that I smelled half as sweet.
Flimsy for the fight, enchanting on one's head.
Leaves are for animals. Animals are for eating.
And it lit up the night, upon the darkest hour.
A terrible evil plagues this flora.
Not enough time in the limelight.
A collection of ferns.
A pig's bottom made this helmet.
Bones of a dark and ancient foe.
It looks as though it might roam the earth any moment!
Tis not as majestic as I once pictured.
All that remains of a terrible beast.
You're a bit slimy for Valhalla.
I'd like some frog boots someday.
It sleeps.
What a treat!
Filled with rubbery protein!
I like when I can see the bones sticking out.
Ugh! Putting it into a cup doesn't fool me.
Fur from a large beastie.
Shed your stone form and fight, beast!
Do not cower behind your carapace of rock! Fight!
Those might look nice glued to my helm.
It lacks its gem.
Showtime!
A spirit trapped between worlds.
A gift! From... the gods?
I must show my allies how much they are valued!
Such beauty!
Twas forged in flame.
A majestic goober.
It was once a wonder of the woods.
A wonder of the woods.
This slop could be useful.
Ohh, look what the goober left for me.
This is powerful milk.
T'would be no help in battle.
A tool of gold!
Gold for gold.
A weapon of very wealthy farmers.
Digging like a king!
Such a pleasing gold piece.
A shieldmaiden deserves a soft bed of dunn.
The life has gone from it.
Loge looks upon you!
Disease festers within its soul.
It is weakening before mine eyes!
That could be useful.
I eagerly await the next harvest.
The heat has defeated this plant.
Alas! It is stricken.
What flaxen scales.
Flowers are not befitting a warrior, but wet armor is even worse.
Enhanced emerald crafting skills!
An emerald stone.
Odin gave his eye that we might see.
Twirly green power.
Terrible!
Charred by flame or not, that will not touch my lips!
It has risen!
Hide, coward.
I see fungal spores.
Yum, creamy!
Hmm, dark wing turds.
Such energy!
How sinister! I nearly mistook it for a true apple!
I shall uncover its secret center!
Tis not meat, but tis close enough!
A clever ruse. It is not corn at all.
A confection to strike terror into any warrior's heart!
Monsters, prepare to do battle with a Viking's teeth!
The perfect treat!
What have I done to anger the gods so?
That monarch swine insults me.
I shall uncover its secret center!
The battle was mighty, yet in the end the worm was consumed!
A weapon fit for the great dining halls!
More fit for labor than battle.
Flowers cannot stop a spear.
Be filled with life!
The stone has taken on cold!
Cold teeth bite at me!
A stone of great use!
Loge would be proud.
The stone has taken on warmth!
Vikings do not wear horns.
Home is where the hearth is!
Signs of a battle past.
A most well placed sign.
I shall write a tale of triumph!
Sticky and gross.
Wouldn't make much of a comb.
A feast!
A feast!
How I long for battle.
A true test of willpower.
Fenrir's spawn!
A fallen foe.
These hounds are true warriors.
A token of a successful conquest.
A loyal companion, if ever there were one.
An ensconced water sprite!
An unfortunate casualty of battle.
Reminds me of home.
Winter dwells inside!
That stuff hurts my teeth.
A chunk of cold.
Teeth of frost!
A backpack of the beast.
A gift from Ullr!
Woah!
I suspect nothing of this rock.
Who is that incredible warrior in the mirror?
Sticky and gross.
The yield of an industrious candy farmer.
A feast!
A challenger!
A conquered foe.
I shall free thy deer this day!
What wonders will you reveal?
A secret, kept under lock and key!
I taste a battle on the breeze!
I don't think I'd ride that horse.
Dearest creature... I am going to eat you.
Poor unsuspecting meat beast.
You don't scare me, goat!
The sack itself is the present.
A lantern to hold back the night.
A fiery foe!
The best allies are made in the heat of battle.
A dragon egg!
This egg looks chilly.
It's warm and toasty.
It glows contentedly.
A faithful, fiery friend.
You must eat to keep your fires burning.
Its fires are dying out.
A fearsome eggy fang!
It's not very scary now, is it?
Your fiery pools are no match for me!
I shall not surrender to the fiery pits!
Stone belched forth by the earth's fiery heart!
That is an ancient woodland being.
That is an ancient woodland being.
Sky blue nonsense plant.
This will return me to top form.
Glow!
It lights the fires of mine heart!
The lightning has made you a unicorn warrior!
May I call you Unicorn?
This could deal a lasting blow.
Oh, great lightning!
Bring with you lightning, Donner!
A spawn of the evil toothed seal.
Burning such magic would seem a waste.
A tree of life, but it is not Yggdrasil.
Flaming log!
Wood is always of value.
The unicorn smiles upon me this day!
It's nice, but it's no spear.
It brings shame to the might of Yggdrasil.
Finally! A useful vegetable.
Perhaps I will be a meat farmer after all!
He looks unhappy upon his throne.
The corpse of the rutabaga still retains its magic.
A stew of magic!
She just wants to go on a rutabaga saga.
Grilled rutabaga.
A rutabaga!
The fuzzy trophy of a successful battle.
Mayhaps the ink is invisible!
The warrior stone!
Fee fi fo fum!
How dost thou grow?
Fit for a palace!
Tis a shrub of stone!
Even the winds cannot knock this tree down.
Hot log!
A shrub on guard.
What a nuisance.
Pond foliage.
It's ablaze!
Burnt.
Another must be planted to maintain the balance of this realm.
A warrior tree.
Arrg! Is that the antagonist to my saga?!
I can see into his pores.
Dark magic lives here.
Shall I unlock it?
A mechanical songstress.
I prefer to roam free, my unicorn and I.
The true fruit of the earth!
Tiny feast balls.
Such a shame.
Let's eat!
It's being prepared just the way I like it.
All this rain isn't helping.
Ah! A dangly rack for my meats!
Excellent battle provisions.
Die soggy beast fish!
Beheaded. Burnt. Stinky.
I could smell it from back there!
I won't miss it.
Is this dwelling made of fish?
A lighted helm! For the darkness.
The chilling breeze reminds me of my frigid home.
The runes hath been drawn!
Tis blank as the cloudless sky.
A surface on which to inscribe ancient runes.
What wonders. Let us duel!
The conquest chest!
Can I add it to my helmet?
He burrows with reckless abandon.
A friend for my pocket.
Who's under there?
It's best to use every part of the animal.
Something fiendish lives down there.
I don't trust you.
What horrors dwell within?
Monster casserole.
Meat of the dark beasts.
All dried up.
Perhaps it crashed from the heavens.
What dost thou want, altar?
It feeds from the power of Mani!
Prepare for glorious battle!
This shall not please the gods.
Mani cannot see us here.
Mani's visage remains, even in the light of day.
Mani claims the skies!
Mani's retired to her realm for the eve.
Mani's power is on the wane.
Mani's power grows!
Mani's gift may have some use yet!
A gift from Mani.
It has faced Mani's wrath.
I wish I could ride it into battle.
Something is bouncing around inside.
A nest of adorable villainy.
Ugh! These things are useless!
Settle demon fury!
The blood will make me strong.
You are not large enough to be a steed.
Loot trumped desecration!
Are there treasures beneath the gravestones?
It makes me long for the stage!
A warrior's tool!
Defend thyselves, my allies!
This helm runs flush with the forest's magic!
Naught but ash.
Destroy the source of its unholy power!
Twas consumed by a mighty inferno!
An empty home for forest sprites.
It is growing strong and hearty.
A blight has beset this log. Another!
Not all can withstand the frost giant's touch.
The forest sprite has taken root.
The forest sprite has returned a glorious bounty!
Laid to waste.
A gift from the earth.
Tis a spotted spotlight!
Twas consumed by Hel's fire.
I demand strong, passionate colors. Red!
Behold! It blazes bright!
What a great effect!
I do like its glow.
I'll fight alongside you any day!
I don't care for mushrooms.
An enthusiastic performance!
What magic is this?
This mushroom needs to be retired.
I'm more comfortable around my own fire.
The fuel of darkness!
It harnesses dark powers from beneath.
Nothing stirs.
Barely any magic remains.
The magic slumbers far from here.
The magic power holds steady.
It's starting to retreat!
It's starting...
The magic is heightening!
A weapon worthy of Thor.
It takes a brave warrior to wield this sword.
It contains explosive components.
Perhaps a sword-wielding maiden lies beneath.
Sing with me! We are the guardians of Asgard!
The spoils of war!
It weaves the cold from thin air!
Gathering has never been so easy.
A stone of orange.
May Odin guide us.
A staff of magical movement.
It contains a mystery.
I prefer to face my enemies awake.
May it carry forth the record of my saga.
Birds of the sea, come from afar.
You cannot run forever!
Tis a fan for mine hand.
Laid to waste.
We must give it the gift of life.
What treasures shall I bestow upon thee?
Pockets of meat.
Thank you Froh for this gift!
These were not made by Froh.
My mere presence struck terror into their tree-hearts!
The secretions of a terrible beast!
A trusty tool for securing spear and helm materials.
He is battle ready, I can tell.
The pig died with honor, then gave to me this pack.
Normally I like a good roast, but this is not right.
This is savagery.
Loge did not smile upon you this day.
Come out and go to war with me!
I did not think pigs could make houses.
Do you not hunger for battle, pig?
Is it pig-Odin?
He died with honor.
We ride to battle!
Will you fight alongside me, pig?
That pig looks brave.
It has been tainted by Fenrir.
The hide of a pig creature.
It smells of breakfast!
Do these pigs worship Loge?
This baby tree is well protected by spiky armor.
It has shed its armor. Grow, baby tree!
A weapon for farmers.
I suppose it's close enough.
Still green, but it'll do.
A plant.
I am a shieldmaiden, not a farmer!
Ugh, vegetables. I'm not sure what I expected...
Bested by the sun.
If %s is looking for trouble, I shall give it to them!
Forged in flame!
Good health to you, %s!
%s's restless spirit could be revived with a heart.
Murderer! To battle!
Freya smiles on %s.
Fruity flesh.
Seared fruit flesh.
Tiny nature bits.
Something lurks in the deep.
Ancient flora.
If only I could use it as camouflage from predators.
What are you meant to do with such a thing?
What in the name of the unicorn is this?
It might make a good bludgeon, at least.
Baked all the life out of it.
Piping hot orange mush.
Do you wish to fight, vegetable?
Tiny nature bits.
An amulet of dark powers.
It is clouded by a mysterious energy.
Odin's eye guides our path.
Jump into my mouth!
There is no escape!
Showtime, rabbits!
It must be intermission for the rabbits.
Good riddance, giant carrot.
What's to be done with a carrot that big?
Armor for rain.
We will fight in the rain.
Its prophecy days are done.
It foretells the coming of rains.
A pile of vegetables. No thanks.
A small blade, but a blade nonetheless.
It is hot to the touch.
A lucky ward to guard against the night.
Odin's eye, grant us wisdom!
A blessing of good fortune!
Umami or not, I don't want it.
I don't want it, but I'm glad it survived trial by fire.
At least it's got a nice color.
And stay down there!
Good riddance.
See you in Asgard, reeds!
Those are some hardy reeds.
Cut down in their prime.
Ha! The sun is no warrior if it cannot penetrate this.
Fit for Asgard.
Ashes to ashes.
I prefer battle to science.
Dust to dust.
Perhaps science can enhance my combat skills.
Its strange power did not protect it from fire.
A mystical thing.
No more meat will come from here!
It is an absurd machine that makes meat.
Valhalla, we come!
Might the gods witness this visage and offer protection.
It holds me back from Valhalla.
Feel the passion inside!
Red like blood.
I prefer your black brethren.
This bird knows about the cold.
Such fluffy feathers.
A prisoner!
Smash!
Some pretty normal rocks.
He may be a worthy combat comrade.
A miniature frozen mountain.
Poor glacier!
Poor glacier!
The lava crust is firm.
The lava crust is reforming.
Beautiful light!
Looks delicate.
A gift from Mani.
My mere presence struck terror into their tree-hearts!
My mere presence struck terror into their tree-hearts!
Chaaaarge!
You don't frighten me!
Strong enough to bind the sails of my longship.
Ruined for eating, but primed for battle.
To absorb the felled queen's power!
A pile of ancient rocks.
A crown... that fights!
A warrior's wand!
Its days are not done.
What foul manner of chest is this?
I shall submit to the gods' judgment.
Mighty steeds can be unsaddled with this.
Now to find a faithful steed.
Oh to fly on the wings of Valkyrie!
I ride to victory or death!
Minerals, not meat.
Tis a castle of sand!
The earth itself dares to fight me!
I do not think I can best this rock in combat.
Clever rock, you cannot surprise a warrior!
Nooo! My spears!
Disease festers within its soul.
It is weakening before mine eyes!
It longs to be a spear.
The small tree has been slain!
It has been shriveled by the heat.
The scarecrow burns.
The scarecrow dost yearn for nothing, now.
Dost thou yearn for a brain?
Rest easy, spirit. Your fight is over.
May the muses guide our hands!
Lain to waste.
A transformative altar for the stone gods.
The muses have been kind this day.
More apt for the halls of Valhalla.
Will this please the gods? Or anger them?
The beast has been roused beneath!
We've freed the figure slumbering in the stone.
A follower of Mimir, mayhaps?
An abandoned monument to the gods?
Might we come to regret this action?
The beast has been roused beneath!
An icon of evil, surely!
Dost thou yearn for a body?
Warriors are not concerned with decorative sculptures.
Gods help us on Mani's night.
The beast has been roused beneath!
I fear we've unleashed a great evil.
It has strayed from the warrior's path.
Tiny nature bits.
Tiny nature bits, cooked to death.
May the secrets of this land be divulged by the gods.
I am no seamstress, but repairs are sometimes necessary.
Luckily I need be no seamstress with this!
I hope this serf is being treated with dignity.
Blackest hearts. Darkest omens.
I'd prefer a ship burial, though this might have its uses.
A trophy of our battles!
It has been razed.
A place to rest one's battle-weary head.
Useful for binding, and for remembering victories past.
Rest easy in Valhalla.
Immortal's sight was not meant for thee.
%s was felled by %s. Live on in Valhalla.
%s was felled by %s. She will live on in Valhalla.
%s was felled by %s. He will live on in Valhalla.
%s was felled by %s. They will live on in Valhalla.
The muses' knowledge, inscribed upon an ancient scroll!
Ah, that was a good battle.
Those who enter thy circle shalt know rest.
The fur foe thinks she's a hat!
I do love furs.
I do love furs.
You are an angel. Of nasty.
A fine battle helm!
Not where I'd choose to hang my helm.
Yes. Slime.
They're smashed up good.
You are not fierce yet, bird.
You must eat to grow strong.
The small bird looks famished.
A nice meaty snack.
A small provision for a long campaign.
I like his helmet.
How much meat is hiding under there?
That is not my favored spear, but it will do the trick.
My comrade in arms!
Cut down in battle, like so many before it.
Eight legs and still no match for me!
I will give it a fair fight by waiting til it awakes.
Crush them at the source!
Squashing these would be a waste of future battles.
Ripped from the abdomen of a slain spider.
A perfect way to infiltrate the enemy camp.
Webbing. Never a good sign.
Webbing. Never a good sign.
Finally, a true test of my abilities.
You are so sneaky!
I'll smash you!
That one's feisty.
Victory once again!
The champion of the spiders. To battle!
It is cowardly to attack a sleeping enemy.
Age has only made this food gross, not wise.
At peace, benevolent flame spirit.
I'll direct this light where I please.
At peace, benevolent forest spirit.
I'll direct this light where I please.
At peace, benevolent river spirit.
I'll direct this light where I please.
Frigid as a frost giant's heart.
Behold! A gift from Wotan!
A storm of pain.
Keep thy hand from out mine fires!
Merely a table.
Cave boulder.
A pointy rock of sorts.
It lives to battle once more!
Tis no mindless beast!
A fiend woven from the night!
That wasn't very respectful.
A curious homage to the gods.
It must be Gunnar. The snakes took his head.
The villain turns hero!
Delicate appearance, but hard as stone. Admirable.
What plagues you, fair maiden?
Tis a stone basin!
It could easily best regular wool in combat.
The sword on the back of a bee.
A hat for cooling after a raucous battle.
Filling the vegetable does not make it meat.
Tis not foodstuff.
Hearty greenery.
A feast for mine eyes!
No wonder it sank. It is not a longship.
It is a handsome vest, but it offers no protection.
Long will the saga of this taffy be told.
A fearsome bird! But I am not afraid.
It will grow into a formidable foe.
It was you or me, bird.
This egg would not survive a Norse winter.
Fight your way out, bird!
Borne of flame! Unless it cooks to death.
A time remains before this bird is to be born.
It will soon wake to this world.
A feathered warrior lurks inside.
A young bird of war will soon be born.
You are not yet ready for battle, bird.
I hope you like vegetables... the meat is for me.
To enter battle with me is your choice, bird.
It requires purple gems.
It will harness my awesome speed.
To Asgard!
A bridge to another world.
The bridge is unstable yet.
The bridge is incomplete.
Perhaps it holds the secret to this land's Bifrost.
A sturdy crank.
No decency. It's not even metal meat.
It appears to be similar to the Bifrost.
Ride through the air and the sea!
It has been razed.
Sleep this night, and prepare for battle on the morrow.
It looks fierce. Into the fray!
Gooey, but dangerous. I like it.
A tough hide.
I will thrust my spear into that mass of tentacles!
A towering tentacled foe.
A gross, grasping appendage.
The lair of my tallest foe!
This material possesses gargantuan strength!
Looks like shiny popped corn.
Tis Loki's frost giant lure.
Ha! Finally, a worthy foe!
Give me your best shot, I'll not hold back!
A cleft in the earth.
You will bend to my blade, toadstool!
Something emerges!
It doesn't match my costume.
Perfect for a nighttime assault.
By the power of the sand!
To save my allies the journey.
I shall desert this foul place!
A present from the mighty lion!
Meat of the nut is not true meat.
A marvel of science.
A well constructed trap. Tonight we feast!
A treacherous trap.
An excellent mace wasted, buried in the ground.
Its walls were torn down by fire.
A place to store my helm and spear whilst I rest.
I am always ready.
A dead end! I must stand and fight.
Toys do not interest a great warrior such as I.
A token of victory.
A warrior encased in armor. I'm told its name is \"Hal.\"
Remnants of Ms. Wicker's summons? Truly a fierce woman.
A small, peculiar woman.
Tea is a luxury that warriors cannot afford.
A noble fighter.
A noble fighter.
A poor weapon.
I must mentor the young one in battle strategy.
A useless toy.
Accompaniment for my ballad of triumphs.
Finally, a safe weapon with which to spar with my new allies.
Cooking utensils do not interest me.
It won't stand up to the rigors of battle.
Not as useful as a battle horn.
Grant me luck on the battlefield!
Perhaps the stench will drive the enemy away.
My allies will appreciate the survival training I've bestowed.
This weak, flimsy wire reminds me... I must toughen Maxwell up!
Even the feeble can wage mighty battle upon the board.
Even the feeble can wage mighty battle upon the board.
Even my spear cannot undo this knot.
Tis not a unicorn.
Tis not a unicorn.
Reveal mine destiny, oh great fates!
The creature has been forever imprisoned upon the ring.
Begone, foul magic!
Twas a poison, most assuredly.
Evidence of the undead. Stay wary, my allies!
For warding off Loki's minions.
A small, peculiar man.
Will it take me to Asgard?
Useless technology.
No time for games! I must train my new allies!
It would make an okay weapon in a pinch.
No decent armor could be made with these.
It will not suffice in the frozen wastes.
The warm pelt of a bested creature. A fine garment.
A juicy reward after a hard battle.
A powerful trunk of a fallen not-so-hairy beast.
A powerful trunk of a fallen hairy beast.
Flee, bouncing coward!
A piece of the battlefield.
It soaks up the blood of battle.
A piece of the battlefield.
Fancy floor.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A warm piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
The road to battle leads wherever we will it.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
A piece of the battlefield.
Wooden flooring, a fine surface for mortal combat.
A true feast.
The wood's ablaze!
Loge took that one.
Chopped by the warrior in the woods!
Disease festers within its soul.
Triumph will accompany its many resources.
It will one one day rival Yggdrasil!
Grow tall and strong.
It will soon return to the earth.
Good for making spears.
Rain protection made from the trophy of a hunt.
No need for food to be so fancy.
A mysterious relic, sure to contain great power.
Waffles are no way to prepare for battle!
That won't do at all.
A minor deterrent to attackers.
Perhaps my foes will get lost in this hay.
Wholly impregnable, a worthy fortification!
Our fortress shall be impenetrable!
Nigh impenetrable.
Only the finest barriers for my fort.
My enemies will dash themselves on these rocks.
A sturdy wall, fashioned from the earth.
Fire, wood's only weakness!
It may impale a foe.
A mediocre fortification.
Those tusks could pierce even the finest armor.
Highland filth!
They have departed for a great journey.
A proper winter camp.
Rended from the mouth of the sea beast.
No, my furs and cloaks!
No use crying over burnt pelts.
That's where I keep my furs and cloaks.
Be that you, Fenrir?
Bees of war!
Prepare to engage in water-y battle!
It makes a good sound when you hit it.
It's almost like wearing a pelt.
You cannot fool me by hiding in frozen fruit, stick.
Warm and red, but it doesn't flow.
Seedy.
%s is tempting fate.
A fellow Viking, forged in flames!
Hail, %s, fellow shieldmaiden!
You'll not away to Valhalla yet, %s. A heart!
There can be only one!
%s, the perfect warrior!
The power of the unicorn is great.
Waxen to the touch.
I sense Loki's influence in %s.
Loki has brought %s into a world of flame.
Greetings, %s, my ally!
A heart could return %s to this realm if we so wished.
%s! Back to your old tricks, I see!
%s has uncovered the kindness buried within his heart.
A tragic tale of woe and misery!
There's a new hunger in %s's eyes.
His flames are as open as his heart.
Blessings upon you, spiderchild %s!
Return with Sleipnir's swiftness, many-legged one.
I've felled greater monsters than you, %s!
%s's spirit burns brighter than Sol.
He fought boldly, but his burial will not be that of a Viking.
Do not test me, fair maiden!
Ah. Have you singed your dress, fair maiden?
Spirits be with you, %s!
%s's restless spirit could be revived with a heart.
%s, your body is weak but your heart is strong! Fight!
%s is channeling the spirit of Eir.
Do you bite your thumb at me, mime?
Don't ruin your fair makeup with ashes, %s.
Good health to you, %s!
Meditate on Hoenir's blessings, %s. I'll find a heart.
May we meet again in Valhalla!
%s has Hoenir's blessing.
Slop.
Tis drenched.
A treasure lies within!
Loud and powerful!
If %s is looking for trouble, I shall oblige!
I'll not question your wisdom, %s.
Good health and wisdom to you, elder %s!
A heart! A heart! My base for a heart!
Murderer! Face me in battle!
The wisdom of Wotan dwells within you, %s.
Should it come to blows, may the best maiden triumph.
%s has more fire in her eyes than usual.
Greetings, %s, the Inflammable!
A heart shall wrench %s back from the jaws of death!
My spear was forged in passionate fires, %s!
%s has a noble heart.
Your honor wavers, %s.
Hm. I worry about you sometimes, %s.
Wisdom guide you, %s!
The fate of the Draugr is not yours, %s. A heart!
%s! Let us settle this in battle!
%s protects our people.
Warm, but not suited for combat.
The measuring device has been slain by Loge.
If only it measured the heat of battle.
How dost I free you from the bread, man of ginger??
Like a snowflake, it is a gift from the heavens!
T'would look as divine on the tree as in mine mouth!
Stay back, foul creation!
We feast tonight!
Twas plucked straight from my nightmares!
Something so foul shall never pass my lips!
Warms the soul.
Imbibable eggs!
A fragile beauty that must be protected.
Tis not a celebration without a good battle!
Tis a light enchantment, trapped inside a glass ball.
Woe! Misery!
Its beauty lives on in our hearts.
A majestic pine, worthy of celebration!
Grow strong, young one! It is your destiny!
Its beauty lives on in our hearts.
It awaits a grand tree!
%s packs a punch to rival a frost giant.
%s seems to have mistakenly fumbled a torch.
Health and strength to you, %s!
A valiant warrior should not be wasted. A heart, a heart!
You will pay for your heinous deeds, brute!
%s, son of Magni.
I could fell you like so many trees, %s.
I did not know %s possessed such power!
You went out in a blaze of glory, %s.
Did he mistake \"Loge\" for \"log\"?
May Yggdrasil bind us as the nine worlds, %s!
The worldtree watches over you, %s.
By Yggdrasil, I will cut you down!
%s's heart is as mighty as his beard.
What's under that dirt?
I smell a trap.
A snake beast from the depths!
Does it swallow those fallen in battle?
Its maw welcomes me.
It is sickly and weak.
Glowing treasure, I can't resist!
Glow! Glow with all your might!
I smell a trap.
%s! You insult my honor!
That metal warrior would see this world burn.
May Thor's bolts energize you, %s!
Metal warrior, it is not your time. A heart!
We shall see whose steel is stronger, %s!
%s is brimming with honor.
A star, captured within an amulet.
A yellow beauty.
Odin, lend us your sight!
It summons the stars!
It is an artifact of this realm.
Flames will soon consume it.
Too dark, even for battle.
Bones and all.
I must wait and regain my strength.
One pet is enough responsibility.
Even with my long arms, I still can't reach.
Oh. There go all my good pocket squares.
How could you improve on perfection?
They're in much more dire need of it.
Nothing ever goes as planned.
Hmph. You're adding too much salt.
I must get closer.
My memory isn't good enough to draw from it.
I had to try.
It's busy, currently.
It refuses to bend to my will.
The dead have no need of such things.
That can already be made here.
I should think not.
I don't think so. They might still be mad.
A living log would be more suited to this.
A mushroom would be more suited to this.
Even The Amazing Maxwell couldn't wring magic from that.
That is certainly not for sculpting with.
Hm. No, that's not right.
It's thoroughly unconscious.
Occupied.
That would be an amateurish misuse of its magic.
The bones were too amateurishly assembled.
When you have a moment.
The dead have no need of such things.
No sense giving them more than they can carry.
Err... I'll let you rest.
When you have a moment.
The dead have no need of such things.
No sense giving them more than they can carry.
Err... I'll let you rest.
Once again the seat of power is stolen from me!
Perhaps I should take a step back.
I could have told you that wouldn't fit.
Curses.
I'm quite adept at waiting. I've had a lot of practice.
Perhaps I should take a step back.
I don't think she'd take kindly to that.
To what end?
But it's already as smooth as a baby's rear end.
It wouldn't fit.
Worry not, pal. I've the patience of a saint.
That can't go in there.
There's a lesson to be learned about tampering with secret knowledge.
I am far too advanced for this.
I seem to be in the wrong place to use this.
I'll not be done in by an overgrown Krampus.
Blast! Wrong key.
I don't know what to wrap.
I'm unable to do that right now.
I can wait... it's the courteous thing to do.
That didn't work.
I need to pass the time somehow.
Ah. The satisfaction of a job well done.
I of all people should be able to do this.
My world is crumbling!
I am attacked by my own world!
An earthquake!
May this tribute sate the beast.
Does this entertain you, beast?
What a chore.
Dark magics are returning.
Here we go again.
The power's growing.
oOooooOO!!
Killing me won't bring back your honey!
Ow! Blasted... clumsy hands!
It burns!
\nI think I can fix this!
The ceiling is going to collapse!
Charlie? It's me! Maxwell!
Ow! Be gentle, Charlie!
My heart grows cold.
The compass has fallen to pieces.
Er... I can't do that.
Damp is not dapper.
I hear one of them coming.
That takes care of that.
It'll be dark soon. Charlie will be waking up.
(Gulp!)
I won't let that anywhere near my mouth.
Ow! That hurt my mouth!
That was putrid.
That was past its expiration date.
A civilized man does not eat such things.
Reduced... to this...
Huff... huff...
This is... peasant... work...
Oh... my back...
I wasn't... built for this...
All my joints... are cracking!
I... was a king, you know..!
That smell... both nostalgic and terrifying!
Thank goodness for the light.
There goes my respite.
Freedom, at last!
They're whispering through the core of my mind...!
My brain swells with power!
My heart can't stand the heat!
The hounds are growing restless.
I am empty inside.
I smell dung and beast sweat.
Drat! It got away.
I can't follow it in these conditions!
It perked up just a tiny bit.
My pockets are full.
The coward has summoned its minions.
Time to beat a hasty retreat!
Its true power has been unlocked!
Ugh. My head hurts.
Can't touch this!
That wasn't very informative.
What annoying little bugs.
Say, pal, you don't look so good.
I must be ever vigilant!
That's a terrible idea right now.
They're hot on my heels!
Not while there's danger afoot!
I can't sleep during daylight hours.
Sleeping now would mess up my sleep schedule!
I need some nightmare fuel.
Traditionally, a siesta comes after eating, not before.
I'm too hungry. I can't sleep.
I'm not opening that on top of this thing.
It's sleep time, not siesta time.
It's a bit creepy out for that.
I have the worst headache!
That might not be the best idea.
You're kidding right?
Odd. They forgot to set it.
Have patience!
Oh, this should be good.
How putrid!
That rumbling can't be good.
What trickery is this!
Knowledge is power. And power is... well, power.
The cycle begins again.
It's deemed me unworthy.
Was there ever a doubt?
Protect me, cursed tree!
How dare you!
Wetter than water itself.
I scratched my arms up doing that.
A shame.
It fled back into the earth.
Now is the time to strike!
Drat.
There are plenty of birds here already.
Curses. Another light down.
It's about time.
Ack!
Hmm, not quite done.
I must wait before I summon the birds again.
Water'll ruin a good suit, you know?
I don't think I'll ever be dry again.
Yech. It's horrible in there.
Oh dear. I know what's making that sound.
You do not belong in MY world!
To arms!
Brains over brawn!
Sacrifice yourself for my comfort!
I'll not be made a fool of!
You've forced my hand!
And stay away!
Next time, pig!
You're not worth my time!
I won't be made a fool of... next time!
Next time the gloves come off!
Why won't these mortals just stay dead?
Hm? What a familiar presence.
It demands a sacrifice.
I should quit toying with this now.
I can sense strong magic within it.
This enchantment is not of my doing.
Whatever it is will be arriving soon.
Even They couldn't build something so devious.
A more outdoorsy type might be able to make something of this.
Over an open fire.
Huh, it seems to belong in the ground.
So that's where I left that thing!
It channels the darkest energies of the universe.
Where are their gods now?
This can be partially restored.
A once proud race.
Some dumb beast passed through here.
Have you no pride?
It's going to wreak havoc on my world.
We've placated it for now.
I'll cross it off my bucket list.
That's some fly mail.
Direct confrontation is quite gauche.
That really isn't my style.
Thulecite meshes so well with nightmare fuel.
Like all things, it craves the fuel.
Wet, soggy, and oddly filling.
That is not dapper at all.
Ugh. I'm not typically one for vulgar fisticuffs.
Wrap yourself in the nightmare. Embrace it.
Somehow, it says even less now.
\"Thataway\"... Ugh!
This requires profundity.
Somehow, it says even less now.
\"Thataway\"... Ugh!
This requires profundity.
A fine powder that smells of destruction.
Don't worry. There will be more Chesters.
There's always another Glommer.
My trip through the portal made it unrecognizable.
It is feeding off the dark energy.
Best not to overuse this power.
Now we've gone and done it.
It lacks a key.
This is a most wretched idea.
It's strange to see it.
No fuel, no power.
It feeds off the nightmare.
I can't believe I've forgotten how to read this.
A picture of the city, before the fuel.
We all know what happens next.
They gained such an enviable power...
I know why you led me back here.
But it won't work.
There's a dreamlike quality to the material.
Sometimes the direct approach is best.
They're even ugly as infants.
Seems we've a few hours of reprieve.
I wish there were porters around here.
Now that is a proper breakfast.
This seems out of place here. Too cheery.
Those look much too jovial for my liking.
Sticky and gooey and good for putting on booboos.
I made a rock so heavy that even I can't lift it.
Ugh. Ugly beasts.
Violence has never felt better.
Ugh. It stinks.
I'm not eating that.
I'm still not eating that.
Hirsute.
Take whatever you want.
See my vest.
This would make a nice rug.
At least they're good for something.
I don't like sleeping rough.
They work so hard, the fools.
Now what do I do with it?
Honey roasted.
So tempting, but so full of bees.
It holds the bees.
Why do the bees not serve me?
So tempting, but so full of bees.
I should wait a bit longer.
I like a creature that knows its place.
Aw nuts, it's following me.
Just look at that stupid beast.
Now it looks dumb AND pathetic.
Yes, you understand how this works.
I suppose some people might find that charming.
I'd only ride you if I was desperate.
It's only marginally less stupid when it's asleep.
How unfashionable.
It smells like a barn.
Keep your backside to yourself, madam!
I'll wear it if I have to.
Not the bees!
They wait so patiently.
Maybe I shouldn't have put that there.
I didn't make that one! Really!
I am not getting that on my shoes.
Now what are those bees up to?
I don't see what all the buzz is about.
I miss sealing a good letter.
More bell.
Just what am I looking at here?
It's seen better days.
It makes me a little nostalgic.
Sigh. If I have to.
A little more refined, at least.
Delightfully sweet with a subtle hint of tartness.
They're quite delicious, actually.
It needs manure.
It better not start talking to me.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
Looks a little off, if you ask me.
Reduced to eating berries. Sigh.
And now we wait.
Too hot for that little bush.
It looks to be in need of assistance. Fertilizer, perhaps?
It better not start talking to me.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
Looks a little off, if you ask me.
The berries will stay fresh as long as I leave them there.
I fear I'll have to wait.
I know the feeling.
Now that is surely fuel for nightmares.
A nut with legs! How terrifying!
That's a deep sleep.
You'll never get me behind bars again.
What's all the fuss about, feathers?
I feel for ya, feathers.
Maybe he wasn't sleeping.
You'll still be in there when you wake up.
Oh, come on. I fed you last week.
They keep falling for it!
I like to think of it as baby bird prison.
Sunny side up.
I'm especially proud of that piece.
How DARE you!
They degrade without proper upkeep.
Just make sure to breathe out.
A glorious tube of pain!
Call me \"Mr. Sandman\".
Never strikes the same place twice, except when it does.
It's frosted over.
Blue brings ice.
That reminds me, I must practice my cold glare tonight!
I know all about that. I... just forgot.
A rare blueprint, indeed.
What could go wrong?
Umami!
The blue ones are good for, uh, something.
It's not ready.
Another time, maybe?
Roughly hewn.
It's not going anywhere.
Grind them bones.
Leave no scrap unused.
What a wasteful misuse of magic.
I've had enough fire and brimstone for one eternity.
It's not wise to toy with forces beyond your comprehension.
I haven't had a real sleep in... ages.
What horrors shall be summoned from the depths?
Beats getting your hands dirty.
It's like showing affection, without actually touching it.
Good for capturing defenseless insects.
Nice and snug.
I guess we could wrap a few things up.
It reminds me of my old act.
Utterly destroyed.
There's room in there for me.
Some puns are irresistible.
It's a flying flower.
It would be a shame if someone ripped the wings off of it.
That should stop its incessant flapping.
Ha ha ha. I got him!
Carrion connoisseur.
Puffer plant.
Cactus? More like flat-tus!
This part of the cactus is always nice.
It would be unwise to put that in my mouth.
Cactus comestible.
I'm going to lose it.
How comforting.
That will keep Charlie away for now.
It needs fuel.
Fiery.
That's not coming back.
How do these things keep getting into my world?
Bait.
You look atrocious.
That's our sugar-sack.
It has pictures of fast things carved into it.
I'm not a fan of vegetables.
A little more refined, at least.
How mundane.
Such labor is beneath me.
Such directionless destruction.
Useless.
Mapmaking is a soothing pastime. Methodical.
Catty vermin.
Well, I guess that's that.
Vermin housing.
Dead head.
Well it's not going to move itself.
We must deal with the others first.
Ashes in one's mouth.
I refuse to be held responsible for that.
Even worse than raw.
It looks like a banana, but I'm not buying it.
I plugged it a long time ago.
When it's less claustrophobic, perhaps.
That was not a good idea!
Off to plunder the depths.
Probably shouldn't venture any deeper.
I'd rather stay here than mingle with the crowds above.
Get me out of here!
Onward to the next thing.
I'd like to step on it.
Nothing will steal my carbon!
There's a reason I never finished that.
That one was a jerk.
Didn't like that one's face.
A brute.
Could use a few more mechanical bits in my opinion.
The pieces are in motion!
I don't like winters.
It never stood a chance.
What a well-dressed figure!
This seems cruel.
A dreadful lack of accordions.
And I thought chivalry was dead!
What an imbecilic expression.
Must everything be about my shortcomings?
I have no idea what that is.
Ceci n'est pas une pipe. Pity.
It's nice, but where's the rust? The exhaust pipes?
The pieces are in motion!
Annoying little monster. Has his uses, though.
Stop looking at me!
What is it waiting for?
I'm going to lose it.
How comforting.
That will keep Charlie away for now.
It needs fuel.
Cold and fiery.
That's not coming back.
Someone should attend to that.
A fire pit.
A roaring, cold fire.
It's getting low.
It's cold.
It's gone warm.
East.
I've lost my way.
North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
It has lost a lot of its power.
It smells less like barnyard, now.
It's still filthy.
Well, at least it's not moving anymore.
A bit overdone for my tastes.
Wait for it...
Here it comes!
Finally, some quality grub.
Just the thought makes my mouth water.
Tale of tails.
High in fructose.
A little more refined, at least.
Such labor is beneath me.
Am I being watched by that rock?
Just like old times.
You are much too trusting, friend.
A wholly agreeable animal.
Quit nibbling my coattails.
You're as fowl as I am!
You're a slobbery little chap, aren't you?
I don't know how they got here.
Shhhh... My pretty.
The mundane stuff of the earth.
Dry, crumbly, sustaining.
I think I could build something useful from this.
The building blocks of civilization.
It smells... noxious.
Oops.
Bathed in fire.
That's not about to grow back.
An acquaintance of mine describes them as \"leafy\".
Shut your maw!
What a staggering sight!
Well it's certainly not deer to me.
Even I'm afraid of that guy.
Deerclops are so myopic.
Filthy.
The gem imbues its attacks with a fearsome power.
That's not doing anyone any good.
Function over form.
That looks out-of-place.
Mostly just background noise.
I can use this to find my missing parts.
It must be right under my nose!
This is the right direction.
I should keep my eyes peeled.
It's the starting mechanism.
I need to insert the divining rod.
Progress!
The portals lead to the next rod.
I'm no middleman.
A fiery fly.
Those scales sure are nifty.
Such a spiffy design!
How undignified.
The red gems are producing a sweltering heat.
With only one gem it is only moderately scorching.
Exotic and delicious.
A little more refined, at least.
Such labor is beneath me.
Quite formidable looking.
Simply exquisite.
The back end of a terrible beast.
Fiery.
It tastes strangely like berries.
Still tastes like berries.
Do I look like a gardener?
I could find a much better place for it.
Do I look like a gardener?
Do I look like a gardener?
I can't believe I'm reduced to this.
It's an acquired taste.
A little more refined, at least.
Such labor is beneath me.
They are at least warm.
It slithers all the way down.
Still rather grotesque.
Just another boring plant.
A little more refined, at least.
Such labor is beneath me.
That was uncalled for.
An empty vessel awaiting decoration or light.
A temporary reprieve from the shadow.
Purely decorative.
I believe it is Wilson's turn to fetch bulbs.
Every lovely flower must one day wilt.
Oops.
Bathed in fire.
That's not about to grow back.
An acquaintance of mine describes them as \"piney\".
Oops.
Dust to dust.
I put it out of its misery.
It looks sickly.
Eye to the sky.
The Meat Bulb's pawns.
Some of my better work.
Now it just needs to be set up.
A harvest of ashes.
Do I look like a farmer?
I have better things to do than watch plants grow.
It needs to be... refreshed.
Is it windy out or is it just this fan?
I always considered myself the peacock of people.
Not as elegant as a quill and inkwell, but it'll do.
Yellow is the color of naivety.
Black is the color of sleep.
Red is the color of fire.
Grey is the color of pain.
Better her than me.
My life is one obstacle after another.
When one gate closes...
A gate for your pocket.
A fence for your pocket.
It's not gentlemanly to carry manure in one's hands.
Great for magic tricks.
How pretty.
I could squish them if I wanted to.
I put fire gems in there as a joke.
I should attend to that.
A fire pit.
A roaring fire.
It's getting low.
It's hot.
It's gone cold.
A basic enchantment, but effective.
Not much fuel left.
Quiet before the storm.
Begone, fire!
Fresh from the murky depths.
I will eat for a lifetime.
These should tide me over.
Cooked fish in a crunchy shell.
It still stinks.
Ow! I cut my finger!
I am filled with the irrational urge to stomp upon it.
This is wrong.
Definitely not my style.
Leafy goodness.
It's so dark down here.
I like that flower.
It got what it deserved.
A meal fit for a peasant.
Ready for the scrimmage.
Perhaps it is best left in pieces.
Was it wise to unleash this upon the world?
It will be the laughingstock of the demon community.
The beginnings of some demonic beast.
It croaked.
It jumps and licks things.
It looks tired.
Has a bit of a kick to it.
Muscular.
Stringy.
This would be great with a simple cheese plate.
Not quite enough for a rug.
Try and get me now. Ha!
Not so tough.
My pets! What has become of you?
The fuel needs a focus.
This one's ready.
It remembers me!
An elegantly wrapped social obligation.
For wrapping odds and ends...
Not the castle I had in mind for myself.
I hope I'm not so transparent.
A flying goop factory.
Flower power forever.
Flower power.
Well, that's rank.
They're sticky.
It's charged with nutrients.
Not my sort of fashion.
It gets sharper with every cut.
This must be game logic.
I'm not sure this was a good investment.
This shovel is worth a princely sum.
This was important to me once.
I could use a pillow filled with these.
Needs manure.
Oops.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
Looks a little off, if you ask me.
Tufty.
Nothing to harvest.
You'd think grass could withstand this heat...
It's sickly and frail.
I'm sure its tail grows back.
It's more \"pretty\" than \"dapper\".
A crutch for pitiful mortals without godlike powers. What?
Only the nightmare fuel will unlock its true potential.
It's useful for keeping in contact with my... acquaintances.
It is a focusing tool.
I should eat it.
Salty!
Green fungus.
When do those ones come up?
Been there. Done that.
There's a mole in the mix.
Disgusting!
Now THIS I like.
Oh good, it's solid candy. I feared something healthy had snuck in.
No one is above enjoying a good lollipop.
Eating them makes me feel powerful.
Waxy, just like me.
Who is making all this candy, exactly?
Black licorice, my favorite.
Almost endearing. Almost.
A mystery I'm not keen on solving.
I am much more disappointed than I thought I'd be.
No one is above enjoying a good lollipop.
How the tables have turned, worm.
An undignified weapon for a less refined time.
It feels good to undo the work of others.
The dapperest of them all.
Just a bit of venom and some dirty old ash.
Pleasantly cool.
It's almost too cold to hold.
A pocketful of stone and temperature.
It's almost too hot to hold.
Comfortably lukewarm.
Makes one feel like royalty.
There's no place like it.
Somehow, it says even less now.
\"You are here\"... I wish I wasn't!
This requires profundity.
Sticky and sweet.
It's full of bee maggots.
Tender.
These look childish, but they're delicious.
Call forth the beasts!
Hot as heck!
They don't recognize me!
Hungry devils, aren't they?
It's a tunnel down to the hounds' nest.
It could be used for fashion.
Stick your tongue in. You're getting slobber on my pantlegs.
Better him in that bowl than me.
His spirit is free now.
Baby glaciers.
A little piece of winter in a box.
Sundae, sundae, sundae!
Strap some ice on your head.
I had a lot of surplus gems!
Its contents are hibernating.
Cool staff.
I can see its true nature now!
It only half-exists on this plane.
I still look dapper, right? As if I need to check.
It's soiled my good gloves.
I think there's seventeen in there.
Cooked to perfection.
What is that bee so angry about?
I've caught a tiger by the tail.
My, what a magnificently horrific creature.
Magic has done things to this beast's horn.
What dark treasures lie within?
Such quality workmanship!
It looks beyond repair.
A distant cousin of the beefalo.
It has its winter coat on.
You won't catch me!
It's really light.
I hope it keeps Them away.
Foul beast! Know your place!
It's no threat in this state.
It's alive in there.
I knew I would make a terrible pa-pa.
I can say with pride that it is comfy and cozy.
It's happy with me, and I with it.
You're not a hellbeast, are you? Nooo. Just misunderstood!
It's hungry. Why is it hungry?
I think it's going to die!
The lavae's baby tooth.
It's cold and dry now.
Spitfire.
A touch hot, but it could cook my food in a pinch.
With each day I get a little boulder.
Disgusting creature!
Disgusting creature!
This fungus survived the downfall.
Who would put this filth in their veins?
It will run out eventually.
It does the job, I suppose.
Chaaarge!
What's it always chewing on?
It'd make a nice horn.
Energy flows through it.
A little bit of protection.
A chip off the old block.
I like the noise they make when you burn them.
It's got a face.
Well. That was fun while it lasted.
It's a piece of wood. What more is there to say?
Gold's gold as far as I'm concerned.
Ah. How have you been, Lucy?
Where did this appear from?
A vicious plant.
Perhaps I can use this to my advantage.
Better him than me.
My ears are still ringing.
There'll be no more crying out of you.
Oh shut UP, will you?
Looks like I got the last meep.
What a disturbing root.
Silly rabbit.
There's nothing to be gleaned from this.
It's strong stuff.
Let me guess, it grows a marble stalk?
Stone cold growth.
I've always wondered who built those.
I've found a shrubbery.
How whimsical.
I should ask it questions.
It's twisted and prickly, just like me!
That was painful.
What a generic little plant.
There it goes.
It's no use to anyone now.
Tree 0, Maxwell 1.
A tree with a foul demeanor.
Looking good!
Hey, handsome.
Aw, it remembers me.
It keeps the master in the chair.
That accursed thing!
It's less painful than it looks. Barely.
I'm used to much finer fare.
My compliments to the chef!
It's too brittle to hang meat on now.
Like the desert.
Still moist.
Moist and staying that way.
It can dry meats so they'll last longer.
My teeth are getting too old for this.
They were already here when I arrived.
Roasted merm head. Delicious.
The eyes follow you around.
Well, it burns just as well as the pigs' version.
They copied the pigs, but they're even less intelligent.
Eventually the firefly will starve.
This pathetic device... gets the job done.
It was drawn in a steady hand.
There's nothing on it, currently.
A sign is useless if it has nothing to mark.
My my, the fuel has changed you.
It's almost like he's still alive.
A regrettable end, my old friend.
I'll take that as a \"yes\".
End of the line.
Are you picking up what I'm putting down? Do you dig it?
No wonder they can dig for hours.
Burrow deep, I'm coming for you.
I don't have time for you!
What a disgusting home.
It would be unwise to ingest this.
How revolting.
My teeth are getting too old for this.
Ruins of an ancient relic.
I had thought these all destroyed eons ago.
The staff is powered by the \"moon's\" energy.
Something magic-y needs to happen, I think.
Waste of a good staff.
The cave provides sanctuary from the \"moon's\" prying eyes.
The gem conjures water springs in conjunction with the \"moon's\" cycles.
The \"moon\" is full in the sky.
The... \"moon\"... has retreated for now.
The \"moon\" is on the wane.
The \"moon\" is waxing.
This will make a decent magical vessel.
\"Moon\" rock.
This might be bad.
It's definitely from the North, whatever that is.
Ride the lightning, you big egg.
Filthy.
Bloody bloodsucking bloodsuckers.
I got him.
A bloody sack. With blood in it.
That's a fluffy... thing.
That one's already been done in.
What lies beneath?
Always did have a flair for the dramatic...
The duality of mine.
It's gonna blow!
It possesses a spritely magic.
Singing it released the toxic cloud!
I don't like how much magic is collecting in that.
Only ash and ruin remain here.
Smells... \"piney\".
The mushrooms have really taken to the log.
Rotten, all the way through. I relate.
Nothing grows in these frigid wastes.
They seem to be doing well.
It's so full it's almost obscene.
C'est la vie.
I suppose we're decorating with fungus now.
A rather pale light.
Who ordered the mushroom flambe?
I'm partial to the lavender shade, myself.
A light to repel the encroaching shadow.
I hope I'm not standing next to it when it goes off.
Where's Waldo?
Oh fine, do what you like.
Ugh, it smells bad.
It's spawning.
It smells of rot and failure.
Could it get any less appealing?
It burns with a beautiful glow.
Ahhh. Refreshing.
The overuse of fuel was their downfall.
The heart of the city is still.
It calms once more.
The pulse has no influence here.
The pulse is holding steady.
The pulse is waning.
It beats once again.
The pulse is quickening.
Good morning.
Snicker-snack!
One third of the way there...
Didn't think I'd ever come back here.
It has a good beat, and you can dance to it.
A sizable magic gem.
The charge has made it incredibly powerful.
Simple magic is often the best.
This will be quite powerful with some fuel.
I have a feeling of being watched, even from a considerable distance away.
It's a focusing tool.
It's a trap.
I'm going to sing a song of madness.
A blank canvas.
Nice tux.
It is addicted to fermented berries.
Now I'll have no problem keeping my cool.
It's no use to anyone now.
Something else seems to be required.
It seems my fortune's changing.
They look superb.
I've a habit of destroying beautiful things, don't I?
It's dripping with nightmare essence.
I think it looks much better this way.
I need to put on gloves for this.
Everybody loves a little mining.
Blech. Disgusting brute.
Oh, that's just demeaning.
Pig roast!
Er... charming.
Let's see you hide in there now.
I'd go inside too, if I was him.
It is not a sound structure.
I'll huff and I'll puff!
That's a man with his priorities in order!
I dub thee, \"Bacon\".
He's simple, but he's mine.
What a slobbering fool.
They're starting to organize.
That one's gone feral.
It was him or me.
That's just nasty.
Great. Now they have fire.
A more outdoorsy type might be able to make something of this.
Huh, it seems to belong in the ground.
The tool of choice for perfectionists.
A feeble attempt to trick the weak minded.
The heat has made this a suitable meal.
That is a generic plant.
It's growing.
It's ready.
It wasn't hardy enough for the heat.
%s seems untrustworthy...
%s has been lighting fires.
Greetings, %s.
%s needs heart-shaped assistance.
Murderous fiend! I'll stop at nothing!
%s tethers lost spirits to this world.
Usually I'd get someone to seed this for me.
A little more refined, at least.
Such labor is beneath me.
I can see my face reflected off the top.
It's some algae.
It's the way of all mortal life.
How quaint.
What foul manifestation of evil is this?
Hallowe'en was always my favorite.
It's been eons since I had a good biscuit.
A little more refined, at least.
Why hello, Mr. Crane.
Such labor is beneath me.
It speaks with the shadow.
Purple brings great power.
A decent enough use of the gem's power, I suppose.
I've been here too long... it actually looks tasty.
Don't worry, rabbit. Everything is under control.
There's a world going on under there.
The entrance has collapsed in on itself.
Cleverness killed the carrot.
Oh, isn't that clever.
Out, out rain!
Not the most dapper of hats, but quite necessary.
The rain did not come in time.
I could just look up and learn the same thing.
Roughage.
If only the world had a single neck.
Red brings fire.
Not having a light would certainly be unlucky.
Its aura can be felt from anywhere. Quite useful.
Why did that bird have this?
I forget what this one does.
Kind of bitter.
It's a red mushroom.
It'll have to come back for it.
It's all used up.
Oops.
There's wind in them there willows.
No more tubes.
Safety before dapperness.
Remnants of an extinct civilization.
The fire learned how to burn it down.
I can't believe I forgot how to build those things.
Flames have swallowed it whole.
It unlocks recipes of middling utility.
Research complete.
This is where I do my own personal research.
That was its final act.
Quite a dapper machine.
No one will be using that any longer.
I'm not above using this.
There's a story behind that...
I'm not sure I really want to give this up.
The redbird comes from the fire lands.
Silence, bird!
You're new.
Nothing up my sleeve...
Better them than me.
It's a rock.
Hmmm. Now what do I do with them?
I banished these guys down here for a reason.
I could get a chip of ice off the old block.
It's just a puddle.
It's just a puddle.
The top of this lava pit has cooled into a fine crust.
The fires are cooling.
It's hot.
It looks harmless.
\"Moon\" rock.
I think it looks much better this way.
I think it looks much better this way.
A castle for my home.
The builders have left it in a state of abandonment.
You'd think this would have more uses.
Disgusting. Why keep this around?
Unsettlingly wobbly.
Everything eventually turns to dust.
Fuel must flow.
The fuel runs deep in this.
A broken relic.
A relic best forgotten.
It seems I am to be judged.
And I may never put it back on.
But that means I'd have to touch the smelly thing.
But is it fast enough to escape the judgmental stares?
At least it affords some dignity to the rider.
So salty.
Impressive.
That was quite impolite.
I can see its true nature now!
There are two ways to see that obstacle.
Oops.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
Looks a little off, if you ask me.
A supple, woody stem.
It'll grow back.
Nothing survives in this heat.
Nothing is safe.
The scarecrow has gone to a place where there is no fear.
It's an empty shell of a man.
At least the fire cut down on the smell.
How I've missed the act of creation.
To sculpt, to carve, no more.
A block of marble might suffice.
Ah, yes. Not terrible.
Hmph. I was never a fan of the Grecian look.
That looks much better.
We'll get you out in a tick, friend.
Come now! I liked that one.
I've seen that head before... but never in marble.
Waste of good marble if you ask me.
Back as intended.
We'll get you out in a tick, friend.
My creations! How rude.
That looks... familiar...
Some truly questionable taste in decor.
Doesn't that feel better now?
We'll get you out in a tick, friend.
Why would anyone want to cover this up?
That's quite the schnozz.
I suppose these won't plant themselves.
Broiled the life out of 'em.
This is a conduit for strong revelatory magicks.
A fine and noble endeavor.
The wilderness is tough on a tailor made suit.
I'm a shadow of myself. Ha-ha!
A pulse of malice and betrayal beats within.
This is some real advanced technology.
I hope the warts are not contagious.
So much for the shade thing.
Rustic, but excellent shade.
Despite its origin, it could make some fine garments.
Ha! I remember that one.
A most tragic and unfitting end.
A pity, %s. So ill-prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. She was not prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. He was not prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. They were not prepared for %s.
I'll need somewhere to sculpt it.
That chest is calling to me.
It appears to be a sleeping bag.
Simple creatures. They exist only to sleep and feed.
In death, this creature will serve me!
In death, this creature will serve me!
I don't remember those...
This will keep me standing, if I need to fight.
That's revolting.
There must be a better way.
Some cracks can't be mended.
What!? What do you want?
You want some food?
He's so hungry!
This is barely a mouthful.
My teeth are getting too old for this.
That's strange. They must be new.
Ornery and tough as nails.
It's a spear. Yup.
I can appreciate a finely crafted weapon.
Splat.
It's mostly digestive system.
Shhhh! It will wake up hungry.
They grow big here.
Squishy.
Distasteful.
Spiders have such malleable wills.
How did that get down here?
How did that get down here?
Maybe I'll just get out of her way.
Creatures in this world evolve at a terrifying rate.
It's a tricky one.
Aggressive little thing, isn't it?
Splat.
It's a specialized form.
I don't want to wake that one.
That used to be food until I wasted it.
Magical red, and yet it holds no power of use to me.
I hope it doesn't stain my jacket.
Hateful, ambulatory whimsy.
I hope it doesn't stain my jacket.
How can a seed be so cheerful?
I hope it doesn't stain my jacket.
An impressively condensed point of freezing magic.
That should chase the shadows away.
Wind power.
Hmph. Impressive sleight of hand.
This must be the work of an unseen hand.
Rocks. How dull.
Stalagmite. How dull.
There is no limit to the power of shadows.
The Atrium's power restored his mind.
A being of living fuel.
The fewer statues the better, I say.
Thank goodness, I thought it was another wretched statue of me.
Not my best work.
It seems silly now...
Hm. Stately.
Her tragedy does not define her.
She's still in there somewhere. I know it.
Someone should use this to clean something.
It's dripping with venom.
A hat fit for a peasant.
A meal fit for a king... or at least someone with a throne.
It didn't put up much of a fight.
Doesn't look that succulent to me.
You're hard to kill. I respect that.
That's not how you use a boat!
It's no three-piece, but it's dapper enough.
It's almost entirely sugar.
These were a failed experiment.
Tallbirds are territorial because of these things.
It tastes like broken dreams.
It's getting tepid.
We've got a live one here.
Hot enough for ya?
It's going to be a while.
Any moment now...
Well. That's tempting.
It's made of dirty beefalo hair.
It's less cute now that it's grown up.
They sure do eat a lot.
A hungry beast is a dangerous beast.
The fuel needs more focal points.
That should do the trick.
It's alive!
My beautiful machine is in pieces!
Now to turn it on.
It is still incomplete.
This is a box full of sadness and woe.
This is used to agitate the humors.
The gears in here are so small they turn the fabric of reality.
This is the quantum field guard band.
Magic can do amazing things, when funneled through the right channels.
That's a bit burned for my taste.
That's a bit rustic for my taste.
I'm glad the rest of it is still down there.
Ugh. This is so revolting.
This is how they reproduce.
This one is odd.
How deep does this go?
Babies?
Ugh! How can it live down there?
An exceedingly rare but useful material.
Several of these piles could be combined to form a bigger piece.
Curious. It smells like roses.
What an abomination!
It is coursing with fungal power!
It's a dirt hole.
Pitiful. I'll make short work of that 'shroom.
That looks filthy.
Some fine haberdashery.
It keeps Charlie at bay.
The magic beckons!
Walking gets tiresome, you know.
The magic beckons!
An impure orange gem.
Nuts and berries. No bolts.
I don't understand how it works, but it does.
Only the dumbest animals will fall for this.
This one packs a wallop.
I'm... sure I had my reasons when I placed this.
It won't store anything now.
A place to store loot.
Hmmm. Looks suspicious.
I can't get through there.
Stop this ridiculous charade, beast.
These must have been heated to an incredible temperature.
Is that a crack about my age?
I'm not listening.
I'm not touching that without several pairs of gloves.
Don't look at me like that.
Perhaps I'll invite the librarian for a nice mandrake tea.
Charlie was the only one who ever kept me in check.
Charlie was the only one who ever kept me in check.
The product of a very immature magician, perhaps.
A metaphor, perhaps.
Admittedly, it's difficult to maintain balance when you're on top.
A complete and utter fraud...
Eliminates the use of the phrase \"You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.\"
I know when I've been beaten.
The monster child gets tangled in this frequently.
I was looking for that.
It's been beheaded.
The strongman's wardrobe is brimming with them, judging from the odor.
This was important to one very specific person once.
Finally. My suits were getting wrinkles. Wrinkles!
It is still beholden to the king.
It is still beholden to the king.
A tangled mess. Like life.
Not a pawn, but still a minion.
Not a pawn, but still a minion.
Amateur magic for children.
The opposite of dapper.
I'm done tampering with magical oddities, thank-you.
I'm not in the habit of imbibing strange liquids.
Permanently bared.
I told you people, I am *not* a vampire!
Don't look at me like that.
A toy for a child's mind.
I might hide those in the robot's bedroll if I get bored.
Not something a grown man should be caught playing with.
I'd prefer a pocketwatch on a chain.
My suits don't deserve to be defaced with these tacky atrocities.
It's more of a fall vest.
It's so hard to look fashionable in the winter.
At least the mucus burned off.
Full of summer mucus.
The trunk thickens in the winter to hold more mucus.
Tumble on, weed.
Turf.
That's a quality, high-pile carpet sample!
Turf.
That's my natural habitat.
Turf.
Turf.
Dusty.
It's warm, but quells flame.
Smells like mud.
Turf.
Turf.
Turf.
Scratchy.
It's dripping all over.
Turf.
At least this one is useful.
Kinda rough.
Turf.
Dirty.
Turf.
Turf.
I prefer hardwoods.
How festive.
Oops.
Bathed in fire.
That's not about to grow back.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
The tree of an amateur.
I could plant it... but why?
It's of no use in it's current state. Only time will tell.
Look at you. You're useless.
Common, but useful.
It's crooked!
It will have to do.
Just what are you up to now, Charlie?
An excellent start to the morning. Or evening.
I told you so.
It's a tinderbox.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
I like to build walls between myself and the world.
Where should I put this?
An ancient wall.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
This will keep the riff-raff out.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
Not tough, nor flammable.
Moderately tough, but flammable.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
Don't you recognize me?
Made in Scotland.
I best not linger when winter comes.
The Walrusser can't be far.
I'll put this to better use.
Oops.
Dapperness is a state of mind.
Fashion without function.
The alpha!
That looks dangerous.
Do you have any idea how much this suit cost?
It's mostly water. Fibrous, sweet water.
This is one way to keep cool. And sticky.
The case is cold on the melon.
Grillermelon.
I could probably plant these.
What is %s's motivation?
The next fire you start will be a funeral pyre.
Greetings, Ms. %s.
Do you desire a heart, %s?
Bloodthirsty warrior! This ends now!
%s has excellent command of the spirit realm.
Well... it's no crown.
My interest in this wax paper wanes....
I know that look, %s. What are you up to?
Do not blow this for us, %s.
What a dapper fellow!
I'll have to pay in blood to bring you back, %s.
Old habits die hard... and so will you!
Trust only yourself, hey %s?
I'm so sorry Charlie.
%s is looking downright feral...
Like a moth to flame. Or a spider, maybe.
Greetings, Mr. %s.
Looks like you got squashed, %s.
So, %s, you're a monster after all!
This child, %s, doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
Reminds me of the good ol' days.
%s has been corrupted...
Don't play with fire, Ms. %s.
Greetings, Ms. %s. How are you?
%s's looking a little too much like her sister. Needs a heart.
Don't think I'll hesitate, murderous fiend!
%s is a true death defier.
%s is giving me the creeps...
Stop burning things, mime.
Greetings, Mr. %s.
I could get you a heart, %s... for a price.
Murderous fiend! You cannot escape!
%s is an effective ally.
How uncultured.
It's absorbent, at any rate.
There's something inside it.
Makes me feel like the master again.
%s is withholding information...
Never pinned you for the wanton destruction type, Ms.
Good day, Ms. %s.
You know the price of revival as well as I do, %s.
Do not start fights you cannot win!
%s has excellent command of the dark arts.
%s is not my ally...
She's a firestarter. And a twisted one, at that.
Greetings, Ms. %s.
We will require a heart to bring you back, %s.
Murderous fiend! Taste my wrath!
%s has bent reality to her fiery will.
You're going off the deep end, pal.
The fire is supposed to go in the pit, Higgsbury.
Err, greetings, Mr. %s.
Are you certain you wish to return to this world, %s?
Our truce ends here, murderer!
%s is a real pal...
How disappointingly rustic.
Who cares?
Not the most useful invention, is it?
Stop looking at me, cookie fiend.
We're celebrating freezing to death, I see.
I don't even use a cane.
It is unbound from time.
How, err... traditional.
It's extremely rich.
Glorified apple juice.
Such a decadent beverage.
My... favorite... she remembered.
Gaudy, like the rest of this shindig.
What a thing to risk one's life for.
How frivolous.
It's a Winter's Feast miracle.
That's that, it seems.
How wretchedly jolly.
Have we nothing better to do with our time?
That's that, it seems.
How repulsively festive.
The strongman %s seems a little unhinged.
Did you intend to burn that, %s?
Good day to you, Mr. %s.
Let's find a heart, %s. I'll prepare my incantations.
Murderous fiend! Behold my power!
%s tethers lost spirits to this world.
%s is going against the grain...
Ha! What a delightful curse.
Yew don't look so wood.
Is it wise to be starting fires, given your predilections?
Greetings, Mr. %s.
That blockhead could use a heart.
Fiend! Time to make like a tree...!
%s seems very in touch with the spirits of the forest.
Something stirs.
You aren't fooling me, plant.
I didn't make that one! Honest!
It's worse knowing what the other part looks like.
I assure you that it smells worse than it looks.
It looks ill.
What a neat trick.
This one isn't very good.
You aren't fooling me, plant.
If you're going to attack, at least finish the job!
Mx. %s is finally making good on their promise of mayhem.
Greetings, Mx. %s.
A shame about your death, %s. You were the only one I half-liked.
Murderous fiend! This will be your destruction!
%s never did respect human mortality.
This will make me stand out.
I can sense magic in it.
A conveniently color-coded place marker.
With a bigger gem it would be so much more powerful.
You tell me.
Won't be long before it lights on fire.
I can't see in the dark!
That tasted about as good as you'd expect.
We don't feel so good right now. Maybe later?
I like the pet we've got.
All our arms can't quite reach from up here.
Woah! Hot fashions!
Not right now, we're comfy.
We'll give them some privacy while they change.
I don't want to. Mom always said the kitchen was dangerous!
Ooo, make something tasty!
Let's scurry closer!
But what should we draw?!
Wendy would've been so happy if it worked.
We can try again when it's finished.
It's not waking up.
Um. We should probably keep it.
We don't need two!
Nope, don't think so!
We don't think we even want them to come back.
It needs a special kind of log!
It needs a mushroom!
It doesn't fit right!
Eight legs isn't nearly enough to sculpt with THAT.
I think that'd make it angry.
Aww... It's sleepy-snoozy right now!
Mom said to always finish my plate before seconds.
We'd rather keep this one for ourselves.
We put the bones together wrong.
We have something for you!
Um. We should probably keep it.
Hey! Make room!
Aww... They're getting their snoozies right now!
We have something for you!
Um. We should probably keep it.
Hey! Make room!
Aww... They're getting their snoozies right now!
We didn't climb into the saddle in time!
It's too angry!
This two piece puzzle sure is hard!
That's off-limits.
It's okay, we can wait for you to finish!
It's too angry!
It's hairy like us, but I don't think it likes shaving.
It's not shaving time!
Clean as a whistle.
All full!
Are you finding everything okay in there?
That's against the rules.
Ms. Wickerbottom will have to explain this one.
I'm pretty sure one of us knows that one.
Is it upside down? Nope. It's just wrong.
It's too dangerous!
That doesn't go there!
But what should we wrap up?
We can't write on that now.
We'll get our crayons ready while they finish up!
Mom told me never to do that.
We're so capable!
We're a super hero!
Play time is over.
The ground's giving way!
It's rumble-y!
What's that?
For you!
Maybe it'll be happier now.
I hope you like our tribute!
That gateway did something weird.
Something's happening.
Let's get out of here.
oOooOooO!!
Flying ouchies!
It hurts us when we don't catch it.
Jeepers, that was hot!
\nWe can repair it.
I think the sky is falling!
Is somebody there?!
Aah! Monsters in the dark!
Brrr... spider hair isn't very warm.
Uh oh, I broke it.
We're missing something.
Splishy splashy.
That sounded like a big meanie.
Doesn't that feel better!
Almost time for bed.
Yummy in our tummy!
That doesn't look like food to us.
Our tummy hurts.
Past its date.
Stale like mum's leftovers.
We can't, we won't, we refuse to eat that.
Ughh!
So heavy...!
Left foot... Right foot...
We... can do it!
Are... we there yet...
Chugga chugga chugga chugga...
Not enough... legs... to lift...
Hhhhfn!
Oof...!
We can't see! I want my nightlight.
Phew, light!
Aaw, the twirly is gone.
We made it!
We're becoming... even more monstrous!
I'm learning so much!
Hot as heck!
Doggies are coming!
It's time for a snack!
Fresh tracks!
Animal went bye-bye.
It's too muddy to track.
Not good enough for you, plant?
Our pockets are full!
Uh-oh, its got friends coming!
Ah! I'm sorry we killed your deer!!
Its belly looks hungry!
Ow, our head!
We're invincible!
That might've taught a toddler something.
Suck someone else's blood!
Our hairy friend is hurt!
Can't! There's scary-biteys about!
We'll open it later as a celebration of surviving this!
Can't nap with monsters nearby!
Can't sleep with monsters nearby!
It's daytime, not bedtime.
We're not ready for bed.
Won't be able to nap with a rumbling tummy.
Our tummy is rumbling, we can't sleep.
I promise I'll ride you again after I open my present!
We can't take a nap, it's nighttime!
No naps til daybreak!
Mum always said \"Don't sleep in a burning building.\"
I can't! It's all burny!
Easy peasy.
Bad bird!
The trees are yelling at us!!
Yuck!
I don't think that was our tummy.
We can't hit it.
It's almost like being back in school.
Everything's back!
But those were presents!
It likes us!
Protect us, tree!
Hey! Meanie!
We're drenched!
Yowch!
Aw, there goes our lure.
Aww, the frog left!
It's looking around for a way out.
Hey! We were using that!
Waah, our light went out!
We're here!
Eek!
Gah! It needs more time.
We're unpleasantly moist.
Wet as a bathtub we can't crawl out of.
That was a scary hole!
Ohhh nooo. We're not friends with worms!
Hopefully we're venomous!
En garde!
We hate it! Horrible pig!
We will put you in our web!
Hey, wanna play?
Why can't we just get along?!
Well, we would have won!
Another day, pig.
Speedy thing!
We didn't actually want to hurt you.
Simmer down, friend.
That's no party poltergeist!
Pretty petals!
Scary blossoms!
Put it down! Put it down!
I think it's listening to us!
It's getting creepy!
It gives us itches and skritches up our spine!
It gives me a goal in life.
Tree or food, there's something inside.
Roasted on an open fire.
May you have a long and free life.
Something wicked this way comes.
It's a fine necklace, I suppose.
Old and full of mysteries.
It's been busted up.
It's throbbing strangely.
Whatever it is, it travels single file.
You're fuzzy. We like that.
I think it's upset.
It's always nice to have more bug friends.
Sand castles!!
Another creature casing.
It just feels like more hair.
Marbelous protection!
Nice and lightweight.
Rattle rattle.
Squeeze our tummy tight!
It didn't protect the last guy.
Wood you like to fight?
It's a bit uneasy wearing this, but so effective.
The lettering burnt off.
We could write on that if only we had a pen!
Ooooh, what should we say?
The lettering burnt off.
We could write on that if only we had a pen!
Ooooh, what should we say?
Funk to funky.
The eyebone didn't survive the trip.
The flower didn't make it.
Whatever it was, it's gone back to the earth.
What's it doing?
It wasn't a way home, anyway.
It looks like it's gonna blow up!
We need another piece to turn it on.
Does this mean we get to go home?
This key is REALLY old.
No light.
We don't like it.
We never learned those letters.
It's a picture of some bug people.
This picture's all messed up.
There's a lot of black goop in this picture.
A picture of bug people escaping their bug outsides!
A picture of a city. It looks like a nice place to live.
They look sick.
Chop and chop.
Get busy, child.
That's the opposite of busy.
It's like a second abdomen we can store things in.
I'd rather have sugary cereal. Oh well.
Balloon animals! Balloon animals!!
Is there going to be a party?!
Bandages for booboos.
Impenetrable.
Screechy mean guy!
Flap that bat like you were born to do it.
Oooh they're hiding in there!
This thing drives me batty.
Tastes like chicken.
In another life, I could've grown this.
Run for the hills!
We'll be the hairiest spider ever.
It's so thick!
I miss being able to properly feel a nice bedroll.
Musty but relaxing.
Always Be Pollinating.
Ours now!
The site of The Great Honey Fire.
It's full to brimming.
It's a box with bees in it.
There's no honey inside.
It's full to brimming.
Work faster, bees!
This one likes us!
He seems to want to stick around.
Big big beefalo!
Shaved you good!
We're kind of scared of this one.
We like to cuddle this one!
This one looks fast.
Slumber deep, beefalo.
The wearer will blend in perfectly.
Thick fur.
So fluffy but so mean!!
It's a face fortress!
It's a hive of activity.
Would you bee mine?
I just can't mosquito you.
Bees aren't our friends!
Not web. We can't walk on it.
I wonder what the bees are making!
Oh, bother!
This stuff gives me hives.
Exactly the right amount of bell.
That teddy bear is moving!
It's all busted up.
A teddy bear.
Juice sacks.
Warm juice sacks.
Yum! Let's find more!
They're so filling!
It's run out of plant food.
Uh-oh! Burnies!
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
Are you okay, lil bush?
Ripe for the pickin'.
See you soon, berries!
Heat too intense for ya?
It needs some poops!
Uh-oh! Burnies!
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
Are you okay, lil bush?
Those berries look so juicy!
It's taking a nap.
Aww, are you sad?
AAAAAAAAAAH!
So that's what's inside!
We weren't very good wardens.
It's the jail.
He looks hungry.
Jailbird.
Eww.
You have to sleep to survive in the jail.
We need to feed him.
Come to our web trap, birds!
A hard shelled egg.
Fried just like mum did.
You don't play by the chess rules grandpa taught me.
Owie!
Bishop of bad dreams.
One step above blowing hot air.
Same as blowing bubbles.
Airborne sleeping agent.
It's a shock to the system.
I guess it's nice.
Glittering and cool.
Hey! Did anyone lose an eye?
\"Follow the instructions\", mum always said.
This one feels special.
You'd have to be crazy...
Good thing we're feeling healthy.
Vroom vroom, mushroom.
Hiding, are we?
Maybe it will regrow.
Logs, but flat.
All these legs, but we don't row.
Boney bits.
Smells like Sunday supper.
This one has pictures!
We don't like how that one ends!
Why should we read about flowers when we can pick them?
It's... beddy-bye time...
Why are the pages all slimy?
Boomerangarangarang!
It's more scratchy than anything.
I'm not a bug! We're an arachnid!
That's one of my favorite things!
Let's cocoon something for later!
Hop along, lil bunny.
All burned up.
For looking bushier!
Butter is better.
Look at it, flitting around happily.
Not so happy now, are we?
Do you know the muffin spider?
Pick our teeth with butterfly bones.
You won't find any carrion here. We're stuck like this.
It's got more things coming out of it than we do.
It's got no meat left in it.
This part is nice.
Haven't had enough, huh?
Take that, pokey things!
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats the cold. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
The fire's getting a touch low.
Nice and warm.
Well, that's done.
That's a yellow bird.
Caught you!
Uh, are you feeling okay?
Treats, treats, treats!
One more point of contact couldn't slow us down.
I sort of miss being forced to eat these.
Easier for us both.
Bury your head, carrot.
We could grow something with these.
Ohh no, uh, oh no!
That's probably why I wasn't allowed in father's study.
Heh heh. I was never allowed in father's study.
A bit more feral than grandpa's cat.
The nine lives thing is true!
Trunk house.
Hat of a cat.
We'll need to mine it down, I guess.
Gotta get rid of the other boulders first.
A bundle of bananas.
Oopsie doodle.
Hot mush.
It's a tropical cave tree, of course.
It's plugged up.
We'll explore when everyone else has had their turn!
We'd rather visit our spider friends on the surface.
I can hear some spider friends down there.
It's plugged up.
They don't have enough space for us!
We like it down here.
It leads back to the light.
Swirly plants.
Hard and black, like my better half.
A mess of chess.
A mess of chess.
A mess of chess.
The fur looks so real!
We've never seen toys so big.
It's... alive?!
This is a really good sculpture.
We can practically feel the fire!
Reminds me of grandpa.
Boy, I wish we could eat it.
We could sculpt a stallion battalion!
It's... alive?!
She doesn't look so mean.
We're sure she's nicer than she looks.
Pawns are just as important as the rest of the pieces.
Bubbles!
Where's the king of the castle?
It's... alive?!
Haha. You make all our stuff slobbery.
Peekaboo.
We spy a tired eye.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats the heat. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
The fire's getting a touch low.
Nice and cool.
Well, that's done.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats the heat. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
The fire's getting a touch low.
Nice and cool.
Well, that's done. But not forever!
East!
No reading!
North!
Northeast!
Northwest!
South!
Southeast!
Southwest!
West!
Cooked to death.
Can't have any pudding if we don't eat it.
I don't know what everyone's complaining about.
Meat treat.
Someone must have left the fire going.
It won't be done for a while.
Almost ready!
Supper is served.
Food goes in, other food comes out.
I always liked pulling Whiskers' tail.
Corn in the raw.
Popping corn.
We could grow something with these.
It looks warm in there.
She's a monster just like me!
He gives the fuzziest hugs.
You look like grandpa's cat!
Father taught me how to take care of goats!
Gobble gobble!
We're best friends.
Oh, you look like you're having a grand time, flying about.
We all want a bit of freedom.
We should be able to weave this, too.
I like me a lichen.
Reeds, web, what's the difference.
Squared rocks.
Scent of doom.
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
Would a cool bandage make it better, Mr. Tree?
My, what nice foliage you have.
What're you so mad about?
Did you change your hair? Looks good!
It looks soft.
He might be able to digest me!
Yucktastic.
Haha, weird.
Don't hurt us and we won't hurt you!
It was once grass.
It covers our biggest eyes, anyway.
Axe me a question!
I can't wield that.
A pile of dirt. I bet it's hiding something.
Nothing nearby.
Lead and I shall follow.
We are close!
Going the right way.
Something must be near.
It's a mystery.
Looks like there's a hole for an oversized key.
It's ready to go.
Radical rod!
I'm not sure I want to be in *another* belly.
Oh, don't you just drag on.
It looks like my old toy chest!
It's a fancy furnace!
What happened to your face?
Hot hot furnace!
Warmish furnace.
It looks suspect.
It looks tastier now.
We could grow something with these.
The front part's sort of scary.
Oh! Sweet and tasty!!
We like the tail!
They don't weigh much for scales.
I just want to bang on my drum.
We love finger food.
Into the ground with you!
Into the ground with you!
Into the ground with you!
Into the ground with you!
Into the ground with you!
Pungent.
No sir, I don't like it.
We could grow something with these.
Strap some rabbits to your head, good idea.
Fresh water-snake.
We could slurp this down.
Blech, eggplant.
Mum knew I liked it braised.
We could grow something with these.
Antiques are dumb, anyway.
Reminds me of antique shopping with mother.
Nice and bright!
Looks great!
It's gonna go out soon.
They look sad.
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
Would a cool bandage make it better, Mr. Tree?
Pines are always greener on the other side of the fence.
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
Would a cool bandage make it better, Mr. Tree?
A dying breed.
Disturbing, but it'll keep us dry.
Ever vigilant.
Stop looking at me!
Wakey wakey!
A razed farm is no farm at all.
I'll have a go at this farming thing.
C'mooon, plants!
The soil is dried up.
This thing is huge!
It looks like it took a whole flock to make that hat!
Haha! It tickles!
Feather of yellow.
Feather of black.
Feather of red.
Feather of white.
She's locked up!
I don't think we can jump over that.
The hinges are a little squeaky.
Let's build a gate!
Let's build a fence!
I saw mum use this in her gardens.
Don't worry Ms. Wicker, we'll be careful.
Elusive little buggies.
Going on an adventure, got some fireflies in our pocket!
He's got a fire under his feet. And all inside him.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Sure beats the cold. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
The fire's getting a touch low.
Nice and warm.
Well, that's done. But not forever!
We didn't start the fire.
Running low on fuel.
It's off.
This would come in handy in a snowball fight.
It could stand to be fried.
I miss grandpa's fishing trips.
One of my favorite foods! Just me though.
Taco Tuesday!
Flaky and moist. Delicious.
Oh, to feel a sharp edge against my skin.
We agree that flowers are nice.
Bright red petals! We love it!
Colorful crown.
Five servings a day.
Oooh, a glowing ball of flower!
This flower is decidedly not nice!
Aww so sad!
Soft and leafy.
We could be good at football, much better than I was!
We want to play archaeologist!
That looks real good!
Maybe we shouldn't play with bones.
Needs more bones!
A hop too far.
Ack! Sticky tongue!
Oblivious amphibious.
Sandwich for me, frog legs for him.
A fraction of a frog.
I admit, we've acquired a taste for those.
Pile o'fruit.
Fluffy, and not from a spider.
Haha. We can stack things on its head and it won't even move.
Yikes.
WX eats them by the fistful!
Looks empty.
Looks good.
That's not a fun ghost!
Oh! What is it?!
I want to give someone something nice!
We think it's great and we love it.
Careful, it's fragile.
Nice eyes.
I spoke too soon. It smells worse now.
It doesn't smell very nice.
Yucky muck!
I wish I'd at least ended up with wings. Sigh.
A glass of milk with every supper.
We wish it had eight lenses.
Life is okay when you've got a golden axe.
The finest pickaxe of them all.
We can do some fancy forking with this.
We're gonna dig so many holes.
We definitely like shiny.
Tickle torture.
It could use some perking up.
Fire, fire, fire!
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
Are you okay, lil tuft?
Grass, next best thing to silk.
Picked down to the stems.
The heat wave bested it.
It's got ouchies in its tummy.
Hey! You dropped something!
Rain won't keep us from playing in puddles!
Time to build!
I'm absolutely green with envy.
We could always use more eyes!
Magic taker-apart-er.
Smells really earthy.
Heat really brings out the juices.
Ready for harvest.
We can't get at it!
It's gone now.
Holy moley, this is tasty.
Bat doodoo.
This black powder stuff packs a punch.
Oh, Wendy! We'll trade you for your choco pigs!
Candy candy candy!
Mmm! Sweet revenge!
Haha ew! It's weird!
Haha, that's not candy!
We aren't totally comfortable with this.
We forgot what good things tasted like!
No worse than the other stuff we've eaten out here!
Oh, Ms. Wicker! We saved these for you!
Candy candy candy!
Gummy worms, yummy worms!
An interesting way to use food.
Chaos and destruction!
Grandpa's style, definitely.
Soothing.
It's getting chilly.
It's cold to the touch.
It's a rock.
It's hot to the touch!
It's getting hot!
We could be part bee now too!
Hellooo? We're here!
The lettering burnt off.
We could write on that if only we had a pen!
Ooooh, what should we say?
Sticky and sweet.
Honey pods!
Ooo, tasty!
We wish they were shaped like dinosaurs.
If this makes a mating call we're all in trouble.
Flavor bombs!
That's an angry puppy!
There isn't much left.
This place scares us.
It's the perfect tooth to gnash.
Give us a Huggy!
He's our new friend.
He was our new friend.
Chilling.
Spoil not, food supplies!
We dream of ice cream.
This should keep us cool.
He has a chilling look in his eyes.
It's fuzzy!
It makes me feel funny.
Move, stupid rock!
I wonder what that does.
Ah! I'm a monster! Haha, we're just kidding.
Ew... sticky fingies.
Will they grow into candy beanstalks?
Foods on a stick!
Uh oh, run!
I hope it doesn't escape.
That meanie imprisoned those deer!
I think maybe this goes somewhere.
Presents?!
Wow! That's complicated clockwork.
Goodnight, good knight.
Maybe it's lost.
We finally found it!
Give us back our things!
We could put more in but we're scared to touch the stuff he left inside.
The sun's trapped in there.
Sizzling hot!
Being all froze up probably isn't comfy.
Maybe I can make it hatch?
Poor egg. It looks cold.
The egg seems happy.
Happy lavae!
It's my friend.
Poor hungry lavae.
It looks starving!
What a weird tooth.
Looks safe now.
Too hot for us!
Ouch! Burnies!
Wow! A rock!
Where did that come from?!
Where did that come from?!
It likes it down here.
I hate taking my medicine!
Bright and delicious.
Lighter than what?
It's all glowy.
My father kept goats.
This might make a good weapon.
It looks all glowy!
This might keep us safe.
He has anger in his eyes.
This log has a face.
Hello, Mr. Tree!
So much for our arts and crafts!
That's a log of wood.
So shiny!
If we talk to it will it talk back?
Weird little plant.
What a colorful plant.
I wish we could learn to generate meat.
He doesn't look like he's having much fun.
The skin is all seared.
We fall asleep in the bath too!
You're a bad friend!
The meeping had to stop.
That's a funny looking plant.
We feel lucky, oh so lucky.
There's nothing on it.
Maybe we should take up sculpting.
Bean there, done that!
You can plant anything in the ground!
Nothing lasts forever on its own.
That's a weird shape for a bush.
I hope it doesn't fall on us.
It will be gone soon!
Hope we don't fall on that.
That hurt our hands.
That's a thirsty plant.
It's extra dangerous now!
Its growing days are over.
Axes can solve all tree-related problems!
A harsh tree for harsh conditions.
That jerk tricked us.
Imagine the trouble he has buying hats!
Well, these would've been handy before.
It's missing something.
We could listen to that forever!
That throne makes our skin crawl.
Some fire would spice this up.
I used to make these with grandpa!
Fire takes all.
Food time!
Is it done yet? I'm hungry.
It's hard to dry when it's raining.
It's not doing us much good empty!
That worked better than expected.
I would've thought they would bathe more often!
I wonder who that was.
A waste of food.
It's in worse shape than before!
Smells fishy.
A handy light for our head.
It cools us when we run, how nice.
That looks nice!
Can someone lend us a pencil?
Let's build it!
Wear that frown upside down.
What a big treasure box!
It's quite tender.
Hello little guy!
Are you comfy?
Come out and play!
It sees for miles and miles.
Hidey-hole.
He just wants to learn!
Did you hear something?
Mmm!
Smells foul.
It's really chewy.
It's broke.
I wonder what it wants?
Bright sticky stick!
Something else needs to happen, right?
I don't think it wanted that.
The moon can't fit in a cave! I think.
Hey, Ms. Wicker! How come we can still see the moon?
Wow! Full moon!
New moon! Neat!
The moon is shrinking!
The moon is growing!
Haha. It's heavy!
Neat!
Oh... We don't like this!
She doesn't look at all pleased to see us.
That would make a huge breakfast!
For its babies' sleepytime.
Shoo!
We should just squish you.
Maybe we can put the blood back in?
Hungry little guys.
Maybe that was too mean.
Our loot sense is tingling.
It's pretty... pretty scary!
Double duty.
Explodey fungus!
It's a cap cap!
We should have chopped it!
I think it's doing something bad!
Fire's dangerous, I guess.
There aren't any mushrooms.
They look happy.
It's all yucky.
You look chilly.
Aw, they're so little.
Wow! So many mushrooms!
Well that's no fun-gus.
It still needs to be turned on.
It's giving off a nice light.
Aw. It was kinda growing on us.
Maybe the night won't be as scary now.
We love all the colors!
Hahah! Wow, it smells so bad!
It's upsettingly large.
It's all round and squishy now!
Bigger than a normal mushroom.
It sounds so funny!
How did it get so big?
This one looks friendly!
It makes our skin crawl.
It's cold and slippery.
Not exactly my kind of nightlight.
Everything's dandy.
Return to us, day!
Not much magic here.
Stable, for now.
Magic go down the hole.
Something's brewing.
It's getting magickier!
Night light, night bright!
Are you seeing this too?
What are we supposed to do with this?
That's a pretty lake!
We need to practice more.
We see eight million eyes reflecting back at us. Neat!
Whew. Gotta be careful where you point it!
Many legs make light work, and so does this.
Orange you glad we found you, gem?
This rock helps me find my friends!
Teleportation gives us a chance to rest all our feet.
Stylish storage.
A well constructed instrument.
We could do our homework.
Where do they live the rest of the year?
Come back! I just want to eat you!
It's so big!!
The fire destroyed it.
The pot's empty.
We wanna give it something!
It does not look like pie...
How colorful.
They make our head hurt.
It's all stone and no bark.
It's a boogie!
Rocks will be ours!
We wouldn't want to cross that one.
It holds so much stuff!
Gross.
We just wanted to be friends.
Not so fancy now, pig!
I can see a pig through the window!
A tall skinny house for a short fat pig.
Why do they hate me?
King of the bullies!
He won't bully us any more.
I never knew we could be friends!
Aw, you're no fun.
They look angry.
He's all furry now!
Take that!
Little pig, little pig, let me in!
If only we could get closer.
It's bursting with life.
Grow, grow!
A good tool to play in the dirt.
It's all squishy.
It smells kind of rotten.
What will blossom?
Is it done yet?
We grew it together!
It's all dried out and dead.
%s looks mean.
%s, you lit a fire!
Hey! Hi %s!
Don't worry, %s, we'll find you a heart!
Meanie! Get'em!
%s is super nice to ghosts.
I didn't expect this to grow.
It's good for us!
We could grow something with these.
Water doesn't go well with our fur.
Just a normal pond plant.
Doodoo.
Mum would like this nice fern.
Mum never let me have these.
That's a huge pumpkin!
Yum!
It's all warm now.
Just like we used to make at home!
We could grow something with these.
Did you hear something?
I can see knowledge swimming inside.
Now we won't need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs!
We just want to play!
He's ours now.
Come out! We just want to be friends.
I hope they're okay in there.
A little overdone and overlarge.
Just like grandpa said, \"You live in what you eat.\"
Dry fur is the best fur.
It'll keep the water out of your fur.
I don't think that's accurate.
It must be powered by magic.
Do we have to eat our veggies?
I watched my father use one of these.
It feels warm, even on the coldest nights.
Our own personal night light!
That rock needs a nap. Its eye is all red!
Thanks birds!
It smells funny.
It smells better now.
Ready for the taking!
We can't get at it like that.
I think some spores remain.
Those burn quickly!
I bet those would be useful.
Only stems remain.
Safety first!
These haven't been used in a while.
I think it's broken.
It's like a science lab in here!
All our work... gone.
Father used to work on something like that.
The fires care not for magic.
We should be careful around that.
Smells like cooking.
Did I just hear a squeak?
It will be of no use to us in that state.
It's a giant doll of our friend!!
Some sort of religious monument maybe?
I think it loves me.
Red is my favorite color!
Held snug in our pockets.
What pretty white feathers.
Let's name it \"Francis\".
I don't think they're having fun.
We'll need to mine it before we can use it.
None of these look like they would skip well.
Snip snap!
Big, crumbly rock.
Ice can be useful.
Puddle!
Puddle!
This lava's all dried up.
It's a little less cozy.
Cozy!
It looks like it might break.
Neat!
It's all stone and no bark.
It's all stone and no bark.
Who made these things!?
You can't rook us.
We could tie stuff up with this.
Ew!
It's goopy.
Rocks from an old city.
And now we are king.
We will, we will, smash you!
It looks broken.
We feel cold.
It's judging us.
Leaves the beast nakey.
We ride!
It's a saddle made out of spidersnacks!
We'll have lots of fun riding on this.
We really regret licking it. Blech.
Not like this!!
Ouchie!
It's in our way.
Something about this rock feels off.
So bright!
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
Are you okay, lil sapling?
These sure grow slowly.
Don't worry lil guy, it'll grow back!
I think the heat broke it.
Someone should address this.
He got dressed down.
Let's play dress up!
They're probably fine.
Oh! There's so many possibilities!
Aww. Can we make another one?
I always wanted pottery lessons!
Wow! It looks great!
That looks really nice!
There! All better!
I think it's stuck in there.
Where's your head, mister?
I think it's looking at us!
I think it really ties the island together.
You look great!
I think it's stuck in there.
Peekaboo, monster!
Did someone lose this?
It's a bit scary, but we don't like to judge.
Oh! That piece was his nose.
I think it's stuck in there.
It was hiding!
Looks like a... cactus? No, that's not right.
A small life trapped within. My sympathies.
Their growing days are over.
Woah! I bet it sees so far!
Mum used to handle all of our sewing.
It's sticky, like a web.
Sometimes scary things are nice.
Why does it make me feel so bad?
Maybe we can tunnel our way out?
Haha! Yuck!
We can't take a nap in that!
Is it nap time?
It's so smooth!
Hello? Are you alright?
It's not very comfy.
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt them!
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt her!
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt him!
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt them!
We need somewhere to make it!
Who knows what could be hiding in there!
Throwable nap time!
Hairy tongue thing!
It's like a tiny rug.
It's like a tiny rug.
We'll slaughter that slurtle.
A solid helmet.
Slimy and rocky.
Slime-time!
Maybe that was a little too rough.
Could this be a friend for us?
I can see its tummy rumble.
Poor thing. It looks so hungry!
A couple more'll make a morsel meal!
It'll keep longer this way.
Let's snuff out that snurtle.
Maybe it just needs a cuddle!
We should stick things with the pointy part.
Pointy ouchies!
Another lost friend.
Spiders understand us.
Aww! I think it's having a dream.
Looks cozy in there.
A portable friendship pod!
I won't think about where it came from.
Very upsetting...
We could stand to live there.
We could stand to live there.
Mommy-Longlegs?
Our friends live up there.
Friends!
Lay down some web for us.
Forgive us, brother.
He will protect us!
They're so cute when they sleep.
Blech!
Our favorite color! Red!
If we stare at it we'll turn to stone!
That's green, our favoritest color!
If we lick it we'll turn to wood!
Blue! That's our favorite color!
If we eat it we'll turn to water!
Woah! The cold makes all our hairs stand up!
Cozy.
We'll huff and we'll puff.
Definitely not a spider!
Is there a spider friend rustling beneath?
Rocks, underground?! Shocking.
Pointy rocks, underground?! Simply stunning.
I don't think it's friendly.
We'll defend ourselves if we have to.
Creepy!
Take that, rock bug!
A statue of some weird bug.
Someone took the head.
We're still a little mad at him. But only a little.
Solid marble!
Nice sword!
It looks real lifelike, but it's all cold to touch.
Scratchy, like father's beard!
We should be careful, we could poke an eye out!
Keeps the sun out of all eight of your eyes.
We will stuff ourself with eggyplants!
It got picked.
We think it's a cactus.
I wonder if mum's ever seen one.
It itches and fits funny.
Candy!
Look at those legs!
Did I hear a meep?
Smells great!
It's shivering!
I think it's hatching!
It'll boil if it doesn't cool down soon.
Looks like an egg.
Did that egg just move?
This could feed us for days!
Where is the egg?
It's getting old so fast!
It looks hungry!
I think it's starving!
It needs something to focus the power.
Seems ready to use.
We could use this to visit new worlds!
I can hear the sounds of another world!
It still won't work!
I don't think we're done yet!
The power in this box is unimaginable.
A crank that will stand up to punishment.
It looks like this goes with something...
I think there are more parts.
Just looking at it makes my brain feel fuzzy.
The fire destroyed it.
It's way past our bedtime!
We would be mad if something stepped on us, too.
We could hit stuff with the pointy bits!
Spotty!
It's huge!
It's huge!
Aw, it's just a baby!
Oooh let's jump in!
Fancy rocks!
Small bits of fancy rock.
It gets really hot.
Yikes! That's a big frog!
Toadally terrifying!
Do you think we'd fit?
Mushroom! It's a mushroom!
I think it needs help getting out.
Like father used to wear.
This should keep us safe.
I hope no one gets a headache.
Floaty and weird.
I think it's ready!
We didn't know rocks could smell.
Crunchy and healthy.
A very well crafted doodad!
Now we can catch some food!
This will hurt our enemies.
Who would put this here? We could get hurt!
It won't be very useful to us now.
We could keep our toys in it!
It's in our way!
We could still play with these, if we're extra creative.
Just like grandpa wears!
Beep boop!
Feels leathery.
It's watching us.
We want some hot cocoa.
We don't know how to play this game.
We don't know how to play this game.
Spork. Spork. Spork. Hahaha!
We like toys.
This toy doesn't work very well.
A voiceless instrument.
Can we dig in the dirt with this?
Mom had one of these.
It's kinda like our webbing!
Are we supposed to blow on it?
No cookies. Yet!
It's stinky.
You're our cuppy cup!
This is stupid.
Maybe Maxwell will teach us how to play.
Maybe Maxwell will teach us how to play.
It won't come undone!
We can't follow the rules if we don't know them.
We can't follow the rules if we don't know them.
It's not bouncy. What's the point?
It's a friend for our finger!!
The monkey probably needed that.
I kinda wanna drink what's left, but he won't let me.
We've already got some, thanks.
Maybe we should hide this before someone gets hurt.
It's watching us.
Yay, a new toy!
Maybe we'll find a use for these.
Another toy!
I miss bath toys.
None of them match!
It's so puffy!
You're always supposed to wear a jacket!
Looks filling!
We took his nose!
He blue his nose.
Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Carpets! Just like in our old house.
Some pretty average earth.
Fancy.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Warm and cozy ground!
Some ground that we dug up.
Some pretty average earth.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some pretty average earth.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some grassy dirt.
Some pretty average earth.
Some pretty average earth.
If we put these on the ground we'll have a floor!
Like mother used to make, in the before time!
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
Would a cool bandage make you feel better, Mr. Tree?
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
We want to climb it!
The tree wants to come out and play!
Little tree!
It's too flimsy to climb.
Does anyone want to play stick swords with us??
Should keep some of the rain out.
It was easy to make with all our arms.
What a crummy item.
Yummy!
It didn't keep the fire out.
This will keep all sorts of things out!
Some grass tied together.
We feel safe behind this wall... it makes us sleepy...
We thought \"moon\" meant something totally different!
Looks sturdy.
Wow, these are really heavy.
Bow to the base-building masters!
These should come in handy.
Turns out wood burns really well.
Like a pillow fort, but wood!
They won't keep us safe if we keep holding them.
I don't think he wants to be friends with us.
Reminds me of grandpa.
I think someone was here.
Maybe they'll invite us in?
Maybe we can use it for arts and crafts.
Fire fire fire!
We can't hide in there any more.
We like to pop out and scare our friends sometimes. Haha!
I don't think that puppy is very happy.
Sounds like anger!
We have to be gentle with our claws if we try to hold it!
Looks tasty!
This is the best idea anyone's ever had.
Just the thing for a hot summer day.
Anything can be cooked!
If we eat these will they grow inside us?
%s looks really mean. And tough.
You're supposed to put fires out when you're finished.
Wow, %s! You're lookin' tough!
Wow! Even as a ghost you're super tough, %s!
We're not scared of pointy spearsticks! Fight!
%s is a super valiant lady.
Haha! It's way too big for us!
Why have paper you can't draw on?
%s looks eviler than usual...
Don't burn our things please. We like them.
Hi %s! Lookin' dapper!
Aw %s, no one deserves to be stuck like that!
You're the real monster, %s!
Wow, %s is really nice! He's helping people!
I don't think we should play with that...
Ah! We look scary when we're mad!
Spiderfriend, why did you light that fire?
A spiderfriend! Hi %s!
Oh no! We should help ourselves!
We won't let you hurt our friends!
%s likes helping ghosts, just like us.
How did this get here?
Are you angry at me, %s?
Uhh, uh-oh, let's play a different game, %s.
Hi %s! Let's play, okay?
Don't worry, %s! Our spider friends will help bring you back!
We're taking my friendship bracelet back!
%s always plays nice with ghosts.
Maybe we can talk this out?
You were just supposed to mime lighting it!
Hey! Hi %s!
We'll help you get back on your feet, %s!
You're supposed to play nice!
%s is super nice. And his makeup's cool!
Experimenting is fun!
It'll probably dry off soon. Maybe.
We hope the stuff inside didn't get smushed.
Oooh, it makes so much noise!
Uh-oh! We're in trouble with Ms. %s!
Ms. %s! We already had our combustion lessons!
Hello Ms. %s!
Don't worry Ms. %s, we'll find you a heart!
Killer! Does this mean we don't have to do our homework?!
Ms. %s is very smart and wise. She's neat!
%s's playing with fire. Err...
Another fire? Well, as long as you're happy...
Hi %s! How's Bernie?
Uh-oh! Does that hurt, %s?
You're gonna get burned, %s!
%s's like a burnt marshmallow. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside!
Why are you being so mean, %s?
Uh... Is your hair smoking, %s?
Hi %s! Nice weather we're having!
You're looking much paler than usual, %s!
Meanie! We will stop you no matter what!
%s doesn't believe in ghosts, but he believes in us!
Mum always said I should take a cap with me.
How come everything turns to ashes? It's sad.
How hot is it, Mr. Thermal Measurer?
I won't eat it. It's our friend now.
Icy icy icing!
Eat twenty candy canes! There's no candy shame!
Yuck! What is that??
Haha, Wendy! Watch our Woodie impression!
Where are the plums?
Apple juice?! Yes!!
It makes our claws and tummy so warm.
It's really, really good!
Can we get a boost? We can't reach the treetop.
Wow, that one looks great!
We want to keep one for ourselves.
Nooo! The tree!
Aw... Why...
Winter's Feast! It's Winter's Feast!
It still needs to grow some more.
Aw... Why...
It's just a boring planter without a tree.
Hey %s, you look upset about something.
%s, no!! Fire can hurt you!
Hi %s! Have you been working out?
I'm sure you're the strongest ghost, %s. Let's get a heart though.
You're just a big bully!
%s's nice! I wish he'd stop messing up our head fur, though.
%s looks angry today.
%s's being gnawghty.
Can I pet your ears or will our claws swish through?
Um. I think you lit a fire, %s.
Hi %s, hi Lucy!
Wanna go heart-hunting with us, %s?
You need to treat people nicer, %s!
%s is gruff, but nice.
Some dirt, big whoop.
What could possibly go wrong?
Creepy crawly!
I think that thing is alive.
I've been in worse.
Gross, that one looks sick!
It's gushing with light.
I dare you to eat it!
What could possibly go wrong?
We thought you were a friendly robot, %s!
Maybe they didn't know fire is dangerous to us.
Hi %s! You look very non-organic today!
Bad day destroying humans, %s? Tomorrow will be better!
Let us introduce you to our world wide web! Sh-sha!
Aww. We'd beep-boop %s on the nose if they had one!
Nice and glowy.
Yellow-bellied gem.
Even with all our eyes, we'd still lose in a staring contest.
We summon you, warm ball of light!
Can we play with it?
Uh-oh. I smell burning!
All our eyes stopped working!
I can't... I don't feel so good...
What if it hatches in our belly?
I can only have one...
I can't place that from this lofty position.
I guess I won't be changing again anytime soon.
What's the point.
I'd like to use that after you. If you don't mind, I mean.
Oh. No one ever taught me to cook.
What are you making...? Smells good...
It's so... far away...
I draw better with references...
Why isn't it working, Abigail?
It's too busy to pay attention to me...
It has no will to live.
They've no need of material possessions where they've gone.
Oh... my information's useless...
No... I can't...
Some things should stay dead.
It doesn't need that. It needs a magic log.
It doesn't need that. It needs a mushroom.
I don't think that will work there...
I think that's... wrong...
That's not the right thing...
Another time. It's enjoying a temporary death right now...
There's no room...
I got it wrong... again...
These bones are grimly misassembled...
Oh... I can tell you're busy...
They have no need of material possessions where they've gone.
They're already too burdened by this world...
They look so peaceful... I'll come back later.
Oh... I can tell you're busy...
They have no need of material possessions where they've gone.
They're already too burdened by this world...
They look so peaceful... I'll come back later.
I'll have to be quicker to the saddle next time.
I'll wait for it to calm down...
Will I never make the pieces fit in this pitiful life?
Must everything in life be hard?
I can come back later...
I'll wait for it to calm down...
I'd prefer to be blanketed by the night for this.
I'm not taking a razor to that.
She's already lost everything.
It wouldn't fit.
Can I use that after you?
I must mind my manners.
That knowledge is beyond me...
I already possess that knowledge...
It's... not right...
Death would surely find me if I tried...
It remains locked, like my heart.
I can't wrap nothingness...
I... I can't.
Take your time... I'll just watch.
I can't do anything right.
All of this is transient.
This will be forgotten too, some day.
Not all deaths are alike.
Oh, now what?
The ground crumbles beneath me.
May the earth swallow me whole.
A gift...
We pay tribute, this day...
Its bloodlust is temporarily quenched.
The dead shall rise.
The beasts are coming.
Death is coming for us.
oOoooooO!!
Bees! Maybe I'm allergic!
Ow! That was karma.
Ow! Fires of Hell!
\nUnlike my heart, this could be mended.
We're going to be crushed...
Demon! Show yourself!
I am attacked!
I am chilled to the bone.
It feels the force of the earth no more.
I lack the necessary materials.
Soggy and sad.
That could be bad.
Your death has been delayed another day.
The sickly sweet scent of roses fills the air...
Yum!
I would never.
That was not edible.
That food was nearing the end of its lifetime.
Was that stale?
I fear consuming that.
I must carry... my own burden...
I don't... need help...
Life... is a trial...
...huff...
Hhnnfg...
...Suffering...
I'm... okay...
Don't worry... Abby... I got it...
The darkness has swallowed me.
And there was light!
The fan has breathed its last.
Freedom. Great.
The ghosts... Want to play...
I have seen the void and it is deep and dark.
I am miserably hot.
The hounds are baying.
I am full of emptiness.
I sense the beast's presence nearby.
This trail leads nowhere.
No trail, just a bunch of muck.
It could use a bit more.
I can carry no more.
Your pleas will fall on deaf ears.
Death walks among us.
The beast returns unchained.
Yet, again I wake to life. Sigh.
So close to death, yet so far.
Pithy knowledge...
Mosquitoes! Let my veins be a feast!
This beast... is not long for this world.
I can't let my guard down right now...
There's no time for presents, death has finally come for me!
I couldn't possibly nap. Death is nigh.
I can't sleep, there's death to be had.
The sun upsets me. I couldn't possibly sleep.
I'm not tired yet.
My stomach is as empty as my heart. I can't nap now.
My stomach is as empty as my heart. I can't sleep now.
Can someone help me down... I have a present to open.
I'd really rather be in a tent.
I'd really rather be in a tent.
That'd be quite the way to go out.
Sadly, it is ablaze.
I was expecting great difficulty.
You try my patience.
A wave of sadness just washed over me...?
Smells like death.
The ground shakes. Will it swallow me whole?
It has spirits to protect it...
I now possess greater knowledge of this terrible world.
The dead are risen.
We failed... again...
It accepted our items.
Nature is good for something after all.
I am caged!
A veritable apocalypse of water.
Ow! Prickly, like me.
A blessing in disguise.
It's gone. The earth swallowed it whole...
I hope it doesn't try to escape...
Oh well, I didn't need it anyways.
Darkness has returned!
Did I die?
Oh, goodness.
Ouch. That was unnecessary.
Even wetter than when I cry myself to sleep.
An eternity of moisture and sorrow.
I emerge into this world once more.
Uh-oh. I think we should leave.
Your life is mine!
Death will find you!
Let death embrace you!
Suffer, worm!
I shall send you to the other side!
I will be your end!
You shall live. For now.
You've eluded death today, beast.
You'll appreciate the gift of life better now.
You should be thankful I'm sparing you.
I won't forget this.
That's my twin sister, Abigail.
It's still so pretty.
I need to show Abigail how to play.
Abigail is ready to play, but she needs some space.
It was my sister's flower. She's gone far away.
I can sense Abigail's presence growing stronger.
Abigail is almost here!
I've never much cared for metaphor.
A tiny life, ensconced in brittle death.
Roasted dead.
A tree will grow soon.
What technological terror is this?
I wonder who used to own this.
It is full of the echoes of the dead.
I hear the painful echoes of the dead.
Not very attractive.
Signs of the beast.
Do you know any riddles?
A deep rage brews within...
The gifts made it happier...
If only I could kick it.
I'd wear it inside-out.
To prolong the inevitable.
Could stop the daggers that stab at mine heart.
A reprieve from death.
I shall wrap myself in death's sweet embrace.
A clinging, dreary, living suit.
A suit to hide from one's problems.
To hold off the inevitable a bit longer.
A perfectly safe way to go insane.
Transient, indeed.
A mark is made, however transient.
Its blank face shall soon offer a secret.
Transient, indeed.
A mark is made, however transient.
Its blank face shall soon offer a secret.
All that's left after another beautiful fire.
The eyebone was incinerated in the teleportation!
The flower was incinerated in the teleportation!
This was once some thing before it got burned...
Take us far from here.
We can't do that again for awhile.
Oh well. I hope it's a quick death.
A beacon of hope left unlit... How fitting.
Hope springs infernal.
I think I know where it goes...
There is no light to be found.
A deathly light dances across the room.
Scrawlings of a tongue lost to time.
A people struck by famine and sorrow.
A piece of their story, lost to time.
They are consumed by darkness.
Then, rebirth.
Finally, a city, full of life.
A tortured soul.
An instrument for industry and murder.
Enjoy your youth. Soon you will learn the terrors of the real world.
Don't wake up.
A spacious sack to increase one's burden.
A balanced breakfast to start another miserable day.
A colorful reminder that my childhood is no more.
These look as deflated as I feel...
There's no salve for the pain of existence.
Trying to break it would be pointless.
A creature of the night.
An enchanted weapon. How exciting!
They're just lurking in there...
If only I could fly away.
They once held such great potential.
That's just nasty.
It could crush me in one blow. I wish it would.
Death surrounds us. Well, our torsos anyhow.
It smells like death.
For veiling oneself in the fuzzy skins of the fallen.
Sleep is but a temporary death.
I'd steer clear of that stinger.
Be still, little one.
Burnt honey.
Their toils have been fruitful!
Their stolen labor tastes so sweet.
Work, bees!
Their toils have been fruitful!
Toil on.
I wonder if it misses its old family?
He follows me unto his doom.
What demented thoughts must lie behind those eyes.
His nakedness is now on display.
The world has wronged you.
More of the world is within the beast than without.
Together we can venture far.
To sleep, perchance to dream.
To cover one's head.
Somewhere, a beefalo is naked and cold.
Their devotion knows no bounds.
This will protect me from those happy buzzing sounds. Oh, and stings.
A wretched hive of scum and pollen.
They're still alive in there. Poor things.
The furious creatures appreciate their freedom in retrospect.
As regal as she is ruthless...
The bees left their sweet mark upon the earth.
It is not a danger... yet...
Dripping with enmity. And honey.
It's useless on its own, just like me.
Ring in the dead.
He dances to forget the pain.
He has passed.
He's had a rough life.
These berries are tart.
More balanced flavor, but they won't last long.
I'd better consume these before death does.
This hasn't halted the decay, merely stalled it.
It is barren.
Its suffering will end soon.
It's not long for this world...
It is on the precipice...
A snack, perchance?
The wait begins.
It succumbed to the heat.
There's no life to be had here...
Its suffering will end soon.
It's not long for this world...
It is on the precipice...
I could strip it clean, if I so chose...
It's given all it had to give.
It has crumpled under the heat.
Harbinger of doom.
Balls of battle!
Bereft of life, he rests in pieces.
Few of us can see our cages.
Must be hungry.
He is happier now.
That... is an ex-bird.
Dead? No. Just sleeping.
The emptiness is eating him from the inside out.
Sticks and silk turned lethal.
So much hope, dashed.
No bird will ever come of it.
What does he pray for?
Ouch...
Time wins all battles.
Shall we set the world on fire?
Blow in one end, pain comes out the other.
Not the big sleep, just a temporary one.
Airborne lightning and death.
A familiar, chilling embrace.
Blue like... er... a sad bird?
Such an icy gaze...
Whoever drew this is probably dead.
I'm surprised we didn't die trying to get this.
A fungus to preserve the monotony.
All is malleable.
Musty.
I would hide too, if I could.
Harvested.
Even scarier for the trees.
It's a boat.
Choking hazard.
You'd be surprised how much life can be gleaned from death and bones.
Will it teach me to fly away from here?
The tome to end it all...
Imagine, a rolling field of red flowers...
Does it impart an eternal slumber?
Does this world need more beasts?
Death returns to the sender.
Oh, to rid the world of fluff.
A prison for tiny insects.
I don't even remember what's within anymore...
Abigail always helped me tie the bow.
What tormented inner lives they must have.
It's unspeakably burnt.
I'm already practically invisible...
I wasn't expecting that.
Pretty, but short-lived.
I hold its life in my hands.
Let's see you get out of this sugary trap!
No more can the butterfly soar.
I hear they feed on the dead.
Knives out.
Flattened.
Even the knife-plant has a flower. Ugh.
It's still dangerous.
Its defenses have been stripped away.
Darkness is looming.
I might survive this night!
A vision of Hell!
The gloom encroaches.
It's a fire.
That is not a good sign.
Such a cheery yellow... I can't stand it.
You're at my mercy, bird.
Pestilence and death will soon claim you.
It's for putting nice things in...
To explore to the ends of this wretched world.
It's a carrot.
It's a carrot that's gone through a gauntlet of fire.
It's a carrot that's in the ground.
It's a carrot that's waiting to be.
Well, old maps always do look burnt at the edges...
No more mapmaking, then.
Maps are best with monsters drawn on the borders.
I wonder if it had a twin, too.
All cats must die.
I could curl up and die in there.
Nothing like the stench of death on your head.
Call me Sisyphus.
So close, yet so far away.
The peels look dangerous.
The death and suffering never ends.
Warmed banana mush is so much better.
Poor plant, locked away from the sun.
Someone is trying to keep the underground at bay.
There's no room at the cave party for me...
I'm too busy descending into madness to descend that cave.
A great evil lurks beneath the surface.
Someone is trying to keep the underground at bay.
Oh... I guess I'm not invited to the surface party...
Why leave? The light here compliments my complexion.
The surface beckons.
A touch of color in the darkness.
Cold, dead and black, just like my heart.
Cold, dead artificial life.
Cold, dead artificial life.
Cold, dead artificial life.
Ashes to ashes, bust to bust. Oh.
A piece, constrained to the board.
They're here.
What terrible beast.
She now lies, cold as stone.
Alas, the king is but a figurehead, at best.
A cold mockery.
Oh, if I could ride away into the night.
They're here.
Such expression in her eyes.
She holds the true power, here.
We are all but pawns in this game called \"life\".
A bubble, frozen in time, can never pop.
A mere minion to something greater.
They're here.
A fuzzy ball of emptiness.
It's looking into my soul.
Not so much sleeping as... waiting.
Darkness is looming.
I might survive this night!
A vision of a frozen-over Hell!
The gloom encroaches.
It's a weird fire.
That is not a good sign.
Darkness is looming.
I might survive this night!
A vision of a frozen-over Hell!
The gloom encroaches.
It's a weird fire.
That is not a good sign.
East.
I am directionless.
North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
North. No wait, South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
It was a good death. You will be delicious.
The remaining blood has been cooked away.
Cooked evil is still evil.
Fire has purified it.
Burnt to a crisp.
Whatever's in there isn't dead yet.
It needs to boil.
Finally, food.
As empty as my soul.
It's matted, patchy and putrid.
I could make a corny joke, but I'll refrain.
This corn couldn't handle the heat.
The seed of life, so tiny in my hand.
Oh. The abyss is staring back at me...
My, what big eyes you have.
Its snuggles almost make me forget.
Cursed with nine lives. Poor thing.
The softest creature in the hardest world.
It's so happy.
Blissfully unaware of mortal troubles...
Take thy beak from out my heart!
He is mine.
It never even knew it was alive. How fortunate.
Fleeting, just like life.
The blade has sentenced you to death.
The better to mark graves with.
This, a fitting final meal.
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
Everything dies.
This tree is spooky. I bet it likes Halloween.
Extra-spooky!
That horn won't protect you.
It lives in a constant state of fear.
Death incarnate!
What terrors must it see.
We have grabbed life by its horn... though I wish we hadn't.
Some chains are physical...
The remains of a tuft of grass.
Now no one can tell when I'm crying.
Oh look. More dirt.
The source is distant.
It is forever seeking its lost half.
Something wicked is here!
The wickedness draws closer.
It is very close now.
What does this newfangled thing do?
It still needs a large key.
What mysteries will be revealed!
I could use that.
The belly of the beast.
It's burning on the inside.
Boom box.
Its teeth do not even gnash.
Pathetic.
No need to lean in and check if it's hot. I can feel it from here.
Burns hot... but not bright...
This isn't shaped like a dragon at all.
Still not a dragon. At least it's dead.
It's a seed. It won't grow a dragon.
What big eyes you have.
Well, at least it's a pie now.
That's just a tall tail.
Scales of pain.
Makes a good thud, and it's nutritious!
Less raw, more tasty.
How sad. You've no home.
How does it feel to be ripped from your home?
I like it dead, but it should probably be returned to the earth.
I like it dead, but it should probably be returned to the earth.
I like it dead, but it should probably be returned to the earth.
Spiky and smelly!
Less spiky, but even smellier!
Miraculously, the seeds don't smell.
Their bitter end offers protection from the bitter cold.
An eel.
An eel that has been cooked.
Almost a deadly nightshade. Almost.
Cooking this nightshade made it even less deadly.
It's a nightshade seed.
Nothing lasts forever.
The shadow equivalent of taxidermy. I like it.
It's illuminating... for now.
We pulled the flowers from their homes for our own amusement.
It, too, will die.
I think it's lovelier this way...
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
Everything dies.
Nature is so boring.
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
Everything dies.
Its cycle of life is ending.
That's one stretchy eye.
They follow their master's every wish.
I do not know why it helps me.
I think it needs to be placed.
This earth is burnt and dead.
What seeds shall I sow?
Leafy tendrils coil out of the muck.
This earth is cold and dead.
That'll make quite a draft.
Ca-caw!
M...maybe I'll doodle something... When no one's looking.
A canary feather, golden as the gilded cage.
A crow feather, black like eternal darkness.
A redbird feather, red like blood.
A snowbird feather, white as the light at the end of the tunnel.
I wonder what she did.
Sort of like an emotional barrier. But wood.
Will it keep others in, or out?
We could use it to build a gate.
We could use it to build a fence.
A bucket of grime.
It needs only a light.
A tiny brightness in the dark.
Tiny lights, stranded from the world outside my pocket.
His disposition is fiery.
Don't give up, little flame!
A flame to keep the horrors at bay.
This fire burns with passion!
It's losing the will to go on.
It's a comfort.
This can be rekindled, unlike my heart.
The world will burn before this staff.
It's running on fumes.
Quiet as a corpse.
I don't know why you bother. We're all going to burn.
It was flopping around desperately for life. The poor fool.
With this the fishies will be ripped from the safety of their precious pond.
Perfectly molded blocks of fish.
Hopefully no bones still linger within.
A proper grilling puts a stop to the flopping.
A tiny blade-like rock.
They are bright and cheery. Yuck.
Prickly and blood red...
But I am in mourning...
Ugh, more flowers.
It looks fragile.
At least they're better than the other flowers.
This is the fate of all things.
Lead me to the Aarnivalkea.
A dead thing for me to wear. Goody.
It is death, preserved.
What horrors have we resurrected here today?
Death has a sense of humor.
We must find more pieces.
Life is small and short.
He's little and warty.
He's asleep.
I never thought frog's legs could look so good.
Torn right from the frog.
Definitely not twitching any longer.
Sweet, tart and in a cup.
This came from a living creature.
A \"puppy\", frozen in time...
I can make that face too...
The insides of a mechanical demon.
It looks so empty.
The gem has focused it.
He has risen from the grave!
The only gift I desire is a swift end...
Abby... how do I make the ribbon curly?
A moment frozen in time.
My warped reflection stares back at me with malice.
Well aren't you a happy little fuzzball. Die.
Even flowers of the night die.
Flower of the night.
Fuzzball excrement.
Even his wings are small and cheery.
I think it's curdled.
They're just for show.
One might as well kill trees with style.
One might as well smash rocks with style.
One might as well till fields with style.
One might as well can dig with style.
Even in purgatory it remains the most precious of metals.
Plucked, just like Abigail was from me.
It needs poop.
It smells funny.
It's not long for this world...
It is on the precipice...
It's just a tuft of grass.
It has been killed.
It just couldn't take the heat.
It's suffering.
This is a creature ruled by fear.
The sun beats down.
A flash of brilliance!
The flaws are its most beautiful features.
A green aura hangs over us...
I can see the power sparkling deep within.
This mushroom is disappointingly normal.
All is malleable.
Dank.
I would hide too, if I could.
Harvested.
That's just gruesome. I like it.
The inevitable byproduct of life.
It is a dark path we tread.
Oh... it's... g-good.
This is... fun...
You have to bite their heads off first... heehee...
The most delicious lie.
Sigh. At least it's honest.
Don't worry, Webber, it's just candy.
Nine lives are not enough to save you from my hungry maw...
Lumps of bitter sorrow.
Life is a swirling abyss of suffering and disappointment.
This is... fun...
As perplexing as it is delicious.
Death begets death.
This hammer does not create... it only destroys...
They'll put flowers on anything these days.
Life brings pain, pain brings life.
Just a moderately cold lump of rock.
Frozen like my heart.
There it sits, just taking up space.
Those that burn brightest, burn fastest.
As lukewarm and lifeless as every other rock.
What dark machinations were once concocted beneath?
A pathetic simulacrum...
Transient, indeed.
A mark is made, however transient.
Its blank face shall soon offer a secret.
A sweet, but fleeting treat.
Pieces of beehive, scattered.
A sweet sauce for this creature's sweet embrace.
Meat cut into tiny pieces. Just like my heart.
It sounds like there's a beefalo trapped inside.
Abigail hated spicy foods.
Stay back, foul minion of evil!
The remains of an evil beast.
Home to the foulest creatures.
Pulled out by the root.
He is blissfully ignorant.
It's not floating, yet.
It's reached its natural state.
Broken pieces of my heart.
It is as cold as my heart.
Ice cream could never replace Abigail.
Keep a cool head.
He has a cold, dead heart.
Nothing can insulate us from the horrors of this world.
A staff to freeze.
It's calling my name.
It's cold and black.
When I look in the mirror, it's like Abigail's here.
The perfect amount of jam.
Beans that shall never know life.
Meat, skewered right through the center.
A bee without conscience.
Be still, little one.
I see him when I'm sleeping...
The key to our prosperity...
Should we peek inside...?
A cold, soulless horse.
Another battle lost to time.
A beast of solitude.
It stands against the cruel elements.
Hello, foul creature of the underworld.
It smells of goat.
Light the way, darkly.
It burns with the fires of Hell.
Cold-blooded.
Is it worth it to put stake in your future?
This egg is almost as cold as my heart.
The egg is warm, but my heart is still cold.
Enjoy your happiness while it lasts, little lavae.
A spark of life illuminating the darkness.
He is suffering the pangs of hunger.
He is approaching death.
Forsooth, it's a tooth.
It's cooled off and smells funny.
It spit up.
I could jump in and be done.
It's... a rock... Sigh.
A lumbering beast.
A lumbering beast.
How does it manage to grow like that?
We were not meant to cheat death.
It's slowly burning out.
Death in a box...
Chaaaarge!
Look at those hooves.
A weird curling horn.
Even this power will run out.
Focuses the destruction.
The cycle of violence continues.
It is forever screaming silently.
Can it never die?
Just a burning log.
If trees could talk, they would scream at the sight of this.
Luck has long since abandoned me...
Hello... \"Lucy\"... I'd like you to meet my sister.
This life appeared from nowhere.
It consumes all.
Life goes on.
I wonder what he did.
Alas, poor mandrake!
Boiled the life out of him.
Onward, vegetable minion!
Now it's just food.
The mighty mandrake. It's best picked at night.
It contains his fuzzy wuzzy essence.
Blank as Abigail now.
Smooth and lifeless.
Cold... but not lifeless...
It cares nothing for the laws of this world...
Even stone can not withstand the constant pull of decay.
Against all odds, it has flourished in life...
Be ye alive or be ye dead?
Even thorns burn.
A bush that always hurts.
Life is pain. Now it has no life.
It's a plant.
It's burning.
Black like my heart.
Its spikes were no protection.
A tree that knows only pain.
I feel a strange kinship with him.
He sure has a taste for the dramatic.
What a curious light.
Looks magical.
Shall we have a danse macabre?
Not quite what I expected.
It is still bloody.
Balled meat. How exciting.
It's done drying. Forever.
The drying is over.
It sways in the drying wind.
The rain is keeping it from drying.
I can hang meat here.
Meat turned dry and delicious.
Horrid swamp thing!
Somehow, it found a way to sink even lower.
No dignity at all.
Fire has broken it down even further.
Time has broken it down.
Hands-free lighting!
When I am still, it is as lifeless as Abigail.
Such a striking likeness...
It is bare...
We must stick it in the cold, hard ground...
He must be lonely, trapped in such a small cage.
My, what magnificent horns you have!
All that remains of a once great beast.
You should go back to where it's dark.
How do you like being torn away from your family?
Stay down there, away from this horrible place.
So this is what those things see.
Down, down, down to the depths.
Living without the burden of intelligence must be nice.
It's filthy.
Cooked evil is still evil. Even in lasagna.
Evilness pervades it.
Meat turned dry and weird-tasting.
It's been ravaged by time.
I felt a terrible chill run down my spine.
Bathed in pale eternal light...
Perhaps it thirsts for a sacrifice. Where's Webber...
That doesn't look right...
Caves. The moon's one weakness.
Does it reflect from the other side too, Abigail?
A full moon looms overhead. Watchful.
A new moon looms above us.
The moon is on the wane.
The moon waxes before us.
It's useless and missing a piece, much like me.
It's traveled so far...
Now it will never decay...
It's an abomination.
Not sure how a thing like that happens.
A cradle of life. I hate it.
It thieves others' life to maintain its own.
I can feel its stolen warmth.
A sack of blood ripped from a mosquito. I love it.
A new life. The last thing anyone needs.
The earth has vomited up its secrets.
Some day, I will join you.
Its beauty is tinged with a heartbreaking sadness.
An item with multiple uses.
Death in mushroom form.
If I'm lucky, it'll be poisonous.
Death has released it.
A death cap, surely.
It is no more.
Emptiness. The natural state of all things.
It thrives... against all odds...
Nothing escapes the pull of decay.
A frigid cold bites at its heart.
The beginnings of life...
Completely teeming with life...
Life goes on.
Oh look... A mushroom...
Abigail would have thought this was... pretty...
Nothing good may last.
Let's turn it red as my heart's blood...
Such a sickly fungal glow...
All its efforts fall on rocky soil.
It looks like a rotting hat.
It has a glowing presence.
Do little gnomes live in these?
It's trying so hard. Why?
These are some strange trees.
This one is frail and scorned. Like a friend.
Eerie, and yet beautiful.
With the sleep of dreams comes this stuff.
It pulls power from beneath.
I know not what lurks in the shadow.
It's almost over.
The presence has departed.
They're all around!
I think they're leaving.
I can feel the prying eyes.
They approach.
Danger in the dark.
Dreams come to a point. A sharp one.
Herein lies the folly of man.
A place to drown my sorrows.
I used to take joy in instruments such as these.
I see a million sad eyes reflecting back at me...
As cold and lifeless as... well...
Temporary release from drudgery.
Such things used to bring me happiness.
It sees all, and yet nothing.
With each use the wielder dies and is again reborn.
Life is a gamble.
Music is the window to my empty soul.
For documenting my pain.
All dressed up, but where to go?
Dumb bird! Stay away from the berries!
It's... surprisingly soft.
Black like my heart.
It's empty...
It hungers for a sacrifice.
A lovely little pouch of nutrients.
Its joy was so disparaging...
They are painted with the colors of my soul.
Now it will never die...
The wretched beast must have been sick.
That the earth itself might be penetrated.
This little piggie looks mean.
They are more useful in death.
He's been burnt down.
Kill the pig! Spill his blood!
Nothing lasts forever.
I hope they're enjoying themselves.
At least they are comfortable.
Always on the outside, looking in.
Live it up while you can, Your Majesty.
He's better off, now.
I still feel alone.
They are so standoffish.
How Orwellian.
A creature of the night!
The hide of a pig that once was.
The place where they wrap pigs in blankets.
It cuts at the darkness.
A tiny life, ensconced in brittle death.
A tree will grow soon.
What a devilish tool!
It has a foul smell.
It's only slightly more appealing.
An edible plant.
Keep growing. I'll wait.
It is ready for the harvest.
It's had the life sucked out of it.
%s... they'll betray us.
Do you wish to see the world burn, too?
How do you do, %s?
A heart could return %s to this world...
Murderer! Cutthroat!
Abigail likes you, %s.
So many juicy red bits to chomp and squish!
Warm, but no less messy.
I was expecting more seeds than this from that thing.
Ophelia? Are you down there?
Some algae.
Life is blood and this.
Its growth is stunted by the limits of the pot.
I would have to be desperate.
It's as big as the hole where my heart once was.
Why indulge in such childish things?
It shriveled a tiny bit from the heat. I like that.
You're not so scary.
It's a seed. Exciting.
It's oozing.
Purple like a... purple thing.
Maybe now I'll lose fewer friends...
He's wandering mindlessly, oblivious to his fate.
He is safely in my embrace.
I'm too big to fall down there.
It's closed up. No one is falling down there, now.
It didn't cook well.
It is not as edible as it looks.
I liked jumping in puddles with Abigail.
What fun is rain if you're not getting wet?
Does that mean sunshine is dead, too?
It measures cloudiness. I like when it's dreary.
A whole bunch of cooked vegetables. Riveting.
This is just for shaving.
Red like my heart's blood.
A light to guide me.
Now Wolfgang won't get \"lost\" when I invite him to play.
What lies within?
A mushroom after my own heart.
All is malleable.
Damp.
I would hide too, if I could.
Harvested.
Soon to be ashes.
It's just a bunch of reeds.
They have already been torn away.
Everything's a vest.
A leftover of an ancient world.
It is unspeakably burnt.
I will learn unspeakable things.
It is unspeakably burnt.
I will learn unspeakable things.
It is unspeakably burnt.
I have learnt unspeakable things.
Madness brings fire.
This is but a step from madness.
I'm glad that fail-safe is gone.
It's just putting off the inevitable.
A futile ward.
Choices matter.
Does that mean spring is coming? I hope not.
He likes being trapped in my pocket.
Life in the barren, frozen wastes.
It's so soft. It is my enemy.
I wonder what they did.
Even that is not permanent.
Some small rocks.
What terrible sights they have seen.
A large piece of cold, unfeeling ice.
A large pool of cool, melted ice.
A large pool of cool, melted ice.
There's a fire in the pit's belly.
The shadows encroach.
The lava's on fire.
The lava lost its will to burn...
It's traveled so far...
Now it will never die...
Now it will never die...
A Rook? Or is it a Castle?
Time erodes everything.
That would be the easy way out of this place.
The way of all things.
We stole it out of the mouths of baby bees.
Broken bits of stone.
Abigail would've loved this crown.
It possesses the power of the ancients.
A pile of broken dreams.
It is touched by death.
It judges my very being.
I'm only taking back what's mine.
As if it wasn't already burdened by the yoke of life...
Too much whimsy gives me indigestion.
Oh, how we bend creatures to our ill intent.
The beasts crave it...
Mockery of a spoiled childhood.
Aim for my heart...
It's calling to me.
Even this obelisk has left me.
Consigned to the flames.
It's not long for this world...
It is on the precipice...
It's trying to grow up.
Maybe next time, sapling.
The oppressive heat got to this one.
Antagonizing crows is always bad luck.
Now the crows will be at peace.
Who would want to scare crows away?
The flame has cleansed this poor wretched soul.
Abigail... You be Death, I'll be the Sculptor...
...I can't be disappointed... If I expect nothing...
That looks... f-fun...
Cleft from the stone.
A beautiful corruption gnaws at its base...
Not everyone can be put back together after falling apart.
It wants out...
The more the marble wastes, the more the statue grows.
How did this get here?
There's a sickly beauty to it...
If only the rest of us could be whole again.
It wants out...
We all have monsters within, I suppose.
Off with his head! Heehee.
I feel... queasy...
It's been made whole again. Lucky.
It wants out...
Perhaps it wanted to hide the shame of its monstrous form?
Strange marble debris...
Life, or at least the promise of it.
The fire has toasted their life away.
Grant us the power of sight...
Another implement for staving off the inevitable decay.
It doesn't mend the hole... merely masks it.
Was he your brother?
It beats with a sorrow to span the skies and plumb the darkest seas.
What terrible secrets might be uncovered with this?
A reminder of the death we wrought.
A preview of the fires of Hell.
A siesta is but a preview of death.
So slippery and fine.
I envy your escape.
A tortured mind dwelled within.
I envy you, %s. Maybe I should play with %s?
I envy you, %s. Maybe I should play with %s?
I envy you, %s. Maybe I should play with %s?
I envy you, %s. Maybe I should play with %s?
I think we could make what's drawn here...
It shall contain my memento mori.
Sickly spores bring such sweet slumber.
Ah, to be so simple.
An empty bag of hunger.
An empty bag of hunger.
It is mindlessly chasing after rocks.
It certainly didn't help the original owner.
The slurtles pop out when they outgrow it.
It shimmers with slimy anticipation.
Pieces of broken slurtle dreams.
Hello there, little one.
Are you empty inside?
A black hole from which seeds never return.
It smells like tiny fear.
Meat, turned dry and delicious.
That one has a larger shell.
I should put it out of its misery.
They who wield it shall become the destroyer of worlds.
It seems a tad dramatic.
We will meet again some day.
A creature of the night!
Evil is sleeping.
A nest of filth and villainy.
A tiny package full of death and destruction.
Even in death, this beast causes pain.
Time to stare into the abyss.
It is infested.
It is infested.
She is regal in her horribleness.
The darkness has drained the color from their fur.
A cowardly spider.
It's chewing on something.
Alas, brave warrior.
A warrior of the night!
I must beware.
Everything turns to waste, eventually.
Its life is short, but beautiful.
So many have perished. But this one is safe.
It has no concept of time, or loss.
So many have perished. But this one is safe.
Be free, little one!
So many have perished. But this one is safe.
Stars die like everything else...
I can almost make out a tiny solar system.
Some weather out there.
A creature of shadow that seeks the light... how sad...
My heart aches with its beauty.
The earth gives up its bounty.
The earth reaches up.
Not even death is permanent.
Do you mourn, too?
Death would be a kindness.
Death has claimed it.
What IS that?!
Maybe these statues will keep me company.
Did it go as you planned?
Cold, hard stone...
Each of us wear many masks...
A chilling thought... what if nothing's beneath the mask?
This offers no hope of warmth.
Sharp and deadly.
When the sun beats mercilessly, life finds a way. Ugh.
A nightshade. Probably not filled with poison.
Plucked from the safety of its desert home.
Life is resilient.
This gilded cage is ceramic.
A cruel trick!
Pieces of dead things, made into a vest!
Who knew such sweet things could exist here?
Free from the shackles of the sky.
So full of potential.
All that promise, snatched away. Not bad with bacon.
Chilled by the darkness.
A tiny, fragile being, struggling for the light.
It cannot bear the heat.
A life sooner begun is a life sooner ended.
Soon now.
That egg represents a new life. Ugh.
The nest is empty. Vacant. Barren. A void.
Will you leave too?
We all try to fill the void.
Your true nature is revealed!
The focus is so lifeless.
Energy flows through it.
I'm sure the next realm will be even more horrible!
No good can come of this.
It's still locked shut.
Is it half built, or half destroyed?
It contains a vital spark.
It looks complicated.
What a hideous creation!
It has no sharp edges.
We could escape if it were more powerful.
A preview of the fires of Hell.
Sleep is but a preview of death.
Long, thin and dangerous!
Sharp, slimy and dangerous.
These are better left unmentioned.
This one is different.
So this is what goes on down below.
Babies!
It shall return, some day.
Its presence marks the edge of the unknown.
Fragments of a powerful material.
An ember that burns with the stuff of nightmares.
Just swallow us whole and end our misery.
I think I'll be reunited with Abigail soon.
Just like the one in my heart.
Look how whimsical it is... We must kill it.
Something has filled the void. In the ground, I mean.
A piece of finery to help forget the inescapable wild.
A tiny bulwark against the night.
The way is clear.
For when I don't want to be alone...
Take me far from here.
It came from the belly of the sphinx.
A handful of sustenance.
Electrical doo-what?
Simple grass has become deadly.
A devious surprise from underground.
Death when I least expect it.
It couldn't even hold ashes.
For which to contain my lucre.
Every once in awhile, things go my way.
Was this placed intentionally?
It was summoned by the death of its family...
Perfectly misshapen.
Another mouth to feed.
I warned you, WX, never ingest bottles labeled \"Drink me.\"
Not so slimy any more, are we?
I'd carry this to the end of the world.
I wish my life force would drain away like the tea.
Winning with only one piece is hopeless.
Winning with only one piece is hopeless.
Two utensils that are one. It reminds me of myself and Abigail.
It conceals tragedy.
The spinning inevitably ends, just like life.
Just a temptation, like death.
My back doesn't need scratching.
This tool has come to the end of its life.
I'm not a-frayed.
I don't have a use for it.
I've never been lucky.
It smells of decay and death.
That potato is as hollow as I am.
Now at least the wardrobe can be organized.
A horse! A horse! My castle for a horse!
A horse! A horse! My castle for a horse!
If only knives solved more of my problems...
I'd rather have the castle...
I'd rather have the castle...
When I gaze into the ball I see... nothing. Apropos.
It's very fetching.
Perhaps a curse could end our suffering.
Neither half empty, nor half full.
Now Webber and I can match.
Drive it through my heart and be done.
I'd carry this to the end of the world.
I'll hold onto it... but only for a friend.
Once alive with electricity, they've met their end.
Just a simple game.
I wish I could take a bath.
Mismatched buttons for a mismatched life.
Skin to wear over your skin.
It may warm the body, but what of the spirit?
It looks even worse now.
I would have preferred the ears.
Separated from its only friend.
Alone, and rolling through life.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
Who's gobbling now?
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
Everything dies.
It's not long for this world...
How all must toil for the necessities of life.
It's sad it's not in the earth.
It looks so innocent.
Thin. Sad. Shriveled.
Plucked from the ground before their prime.
The clouds weep.
It looks more appetizing this way.
It's not done, like life.
They're definitely waffles.
Defenses down.
That is a mere suggestion of defense.
Their defensive value is questionable.
The moon... she whispers promises of protection to me.
This gift from above should not go to waste.
These didn't protect the ancients, now did they!
Are the very stones haunted?
What will protect me from what's inside?
These won't protect from the demons within.
The inevitable is coming.
It will only delay the inevitable.
Bundled logs.
An old man of the sea.
What feverish thoughts transpired beneath this?
If they are not in there, where are they?
This home is not a happy one, I fear.
I gnash at thee.
Soon it will be nothing but ashes.
Now it doesn't remind me of anything.
It reminds me of a story I used to read with Abigail.
A true bastion of evil.
They hide in their fortress of hate.
At any moment it could pop and spill its guts.
It's mostly water. What's the big deal?
It makes the wearer's head sticky. Yuck.
The melon is in stasis.
Now it's warm water.
Perfectly shaped for spitting.
%s... she's bloodthirsty.
Do the Norse have a god of fire, %s?
How do you do, %s?
Come back, %s... Take my heart...
It'll all be over soon, %s.
It seems your heart is strong too, %s...
I've never seen her take it off before...
It feels so... nostalgic.
I don't think I trust %s yet.
Are you trying to kindle a bad reputation?
How are you coping, %s?
Should I revive you, %s? Hmm...
Cursed villain!
From Sisyphus to Lazarus, hey %s?
Do you want me to read you a story, Abigail?
%s, are you friend... or foe?
%s, let's find a game that doesn't involve... burning.
Hey, %s!
A heart could bring back my friend, %s...
Don't worry, %s. This won't hurt a bit.
You could never be a monster, %s.
He's better this way.
%s... she's no sister of mine.
Fire probably isn't the method I would choose...
She looks sad...
At least a heart could return one sister to this world...
Have we not seen enough death, %s?
I hope Abigail doesn't like you more than me...
%s... there's something you're not telling us...
There are other ways to express yourself, %s.
How do you do, %s?
If I get you a heart you won't leave us, right %s?
%s, this is the end... for you!
Abigail says she understands you, %s.
A miserable mess, just like life.
Yuck.
It came from the depths.
It only provides the illusion of control.
Ms. %s... do you turn your wits against us?
Ms. %s, wreathed in flames.
How do you do, Ms. %s?
Everyone that leaves takes a piece of my heart...
\"Murder\", she wrote.
Abigail likes you, Ms. %s.
%s is a madwoman.
Let's watch the world burn together, %s.
How do you do, %s?
Say hi to Abigail while I get you a heart, %s.
You've made a terrible error, %s.
Abigail likes you, %s. Do you like her?
%s is unstable.
Douse your fires, %s.
How do you do, %s?
That was a bad experiment, %s...
You've gone mad, scientist.
Abigail likes you, %s.
It helps stave off the encroaching cold.
Does that mean my day to die is here?
Why do I feel that it is measuring our mortality?
I'm going to eat you.
Not nearly sweet enough to balance out this bitter world.
If you eat it right... the end gets sharp...
It is filled with chunks of evil.
It tastes okay, but I've grown tired of logs...
I'm going to lick all the icing off...
I don't want Winter's Feast to end...
I missed cocoa.
So aggressively delicious. You can't help but feel better.
Do you like this one, Abigail?
This is one of my favorites.
Bright lights... Cold nights...
Oh.
Death comes for all of us...
Oh, joy.
It's not ready yet.
Death comes for all of us...
We can plant a Winter's Feast tree.
I don't trust %s. Fear makes people dangerous.
Fire won't protect you, %s.
Hi %s. Why are you shaking?
%s... Everyone leaves...
Your strength is meaningless if you can't catch me...
Don't be scared, %s. Abigail just wants to be friends.
%s is plotting something dastardly with that axe.
He pinky-promised I'd get to ride on his shoulders next time. Such lies.
The curse haunts you even in death, %s? I'm so sorry.
Fire setting does not seem in your best interest...
How do you do, %s?
We'll get a heart, but are you sure you want to come back, %s?
I'll send you someplace much nicer than this, %s.
Abigail likes you, %s. But she likes Lucy more.
Is something there?
It seems out of place.
It comes from the depths.
Life doesn't always make sense.
No matter what it consumes, it is never satisfied.
It will soon give up.
There's a slight humming coming from it.
Better the worm's light than its tongue.
It seems out of place.
Do you have a conscience, %s?
I was starting to think you were all talk, %s.
How do you do, %s?
Say \"Pretty Please\" and I might get you a heart, %s.
None of us are above death, %s!
Abigail likes you, %s.
A brief light in a dark life.
It reminds me of my mother.
What color were mother's eyes?
The stick is as twisted as my soul.
Sigh... I don't know.
It's about to be swallowed by flames.
The darkness! It is too dark!
I spared it the torment of living.
I'm feeling too ill for that.
One domestic creature is enough for me.
In this elevated position, I can't reach the ground.
No more changes for me. It's gone up in flames.
I think I look pretty smart already.
If I could use that after you, dear.
Perhaps later. Not all old ladies enjoy cooking, you know.
Mmm, smells lovely, dear.
It is not within my reach.
An example of what I should diagram would be helpful.
Her spirit is already bound to something in this world.
I'll try again when it's done.
Conditions are not right.
That would be a waste.
We've already taken note of this recipe.
I don't think so, dear.
I'll not be meddling in that business.
It needs a log, imbued with magical properties.
Goodness no, it needs a fresh mushroom.
Don't be silly, dear.
No one ought to sculpt with that, dear.
This is not the staff I seek.
It appears to be sleeping.
Let's finish what's on our plate first, shall we?
This gemstone's properties are incorrect for my purposes.
The skeletal anatomy is incorrect.
I'll try again when they're free.
That would be a waste.
They're already heavily burdened.
They've entered REM sleep. No need to disturb them.
I'll try again when they're free.
That would be a waste.
They're already heavily burdened.
They've entered REM sleep. No need to disturb them.
Patience is required. I can ride this beefalo later.
It would be ill-advised to approach that scuffle.
Other matters await.
The birds are not keen on this weather.
That is clearly the incorrect piece.
I've other things on my mind currently.
Be sure to sort by color and weight, dear.
It would be ill-advised to approach that scuffle.
I think he might object to that.
I would really rather not.
It's already smooth, dear.
It's full to the brim, I'm afraid.
I do hope you're keeping organized, my dear.
Nonsense.
A piece of knowledge I cannot grasp... Intriguing!
Please. That knowledge is child's play.
This map is for some other location.
The beast must first be defeated.
That may have been the wrong implement.
I have to know what to wrap, dear.
I'd rather write in my own books.
When you're done, dear.
It seems I can't do that.
It's not there yet!
File that under completed!
We must learn from our failures.
The ground will soon give way.
Not the work of tectonic plates.
A six on the Richter scale.
For you, great Panthera auropunctata.
It ought to be more docile now.
The great Panthera auropunctata is tamed.
I do believe it's time to go.
It's dangerous to be here.
Goodness gracious!
oOoooOoO!!
Stinging nasties!
I misjudged the timing of its return.
First degree, at least!
\nI do believe I can repair this.
The rocks above will soon give way.
A noise! And a distinctly floral scent?
OUCH! Who dares?!
The ambient temperature is low.
My compass has become demagnetized.
I can't make that now.
The layer of water begins to build up.
That sounds quite large!
Caught it just in time. The roots were nearly rotten.
Night will be here soon.
Yum!
This cannot be consumed.
I should not have ingested that.
That was partially decomposed.
That was not at optimal freshness.
Ingesting this would be ill-advised.
It's all in the legs.
Goodness...
Dear me...
I've got it, dear.
I'm more spry than I look!
You just need to know how to lift!
No sweat off my back! Ho ho!
How invigorating!
This gets the blood pumping!
I am in the dark.
It is bright enough to see.
This fragile device has decayed.
Freedom! I'll find a good book and tuck in.
My humanity... it's slipping.
My my, that was extremely interesting!
The ambient temperature is high.
Something is approaching.
Librarian needs food.
The appearance of this track indicates recent activity.
The trail is no longer distinguishable.
The trail's been washed away by the precipitation.
It needs just a touch more fecal assistance, I'd say.
I can't carry anything more.
Careful! It has summoned lesser Krampii.
No sense throwing one's life away. Fall back!
Whatever enchantment restrained it has been undone.
Oof, that's one way to get some rest, I suppose.
Thank goodness for this non-conductive clothing!
Not a great resource, but there were useful bits.
Cursed bloodsuckers!
My mount requires attention of the medical variety.
Were I to lose focus now I'd be sure to sustain bodily injury.
Presents are not a top survival priority at this moment.
I can't lie down when I'm in danger!
I can barely sleep even when I'm not in danger!
I can hardly get to sleep at night, nevermind during the day.
These caves don't make it any easier to sleep.
My hunger won't make relaxing any easier!
I can barely sleep even when I'm not starving!
I do believe I should dismount first.
I can't sleep, no matter where I lie down.
I couldn't possibly relax in these caves.
Even if I could sleep, these temperatures are highly unsafe.
As you can plainly see, it is ablaze.
A cinch!
Settle down, this instant!
The chemical reaction has been catalyzed...
This plant is exhibiting concerning signs.
A tremor! At least magnitude seven on the Richter scale.
There's magic at work here.
No information should go to waste, no matter how trivial.
Careful, the monsters are back.
Shoot. I thought I had it.
That did the trick.
Ah, a welcome respite.
You can't hold me for long, dear.
Positively soaked.
Dang spinose structure!
That's that.
It has burrowed away.
It will need to burrow soon to rehydrate its skin.
My grip!
It doesn't work as well with this many birds around.
I need another light.
Goodness! That's one way to travel.
Eek!
Tut tut, I don't think it's quite ready.
The sky is out of birds for now.
I wonder what my body's saturation point is...
Wet, wet, wet!
A detailed lesson in biology!
Something nasty intends to rear its head.
This will be easy.
Combat!
Foul cad!
Just give up.
Behave!
Respect your elders!
Well, that's over.
Oh dear.
I must reassess the situation.
I must read up on this!
Back to the drawing board!
Fascinating. Can you speak, specter?
Ah... I'm not familiar with this strain of flower.
Does it expect something of me?
I feel I should set it down now.
Odd...
It's emitting a strange energy.
The flower's energy is growing powerful.
I feel a compulsive urge to activate it, again and again.
Deciduous seeds encased in a Pericarp.
The poison has been successfully cooked out of them.
Deciduous seeds approaching maturity.
That violates some pretty fundamental physical laws.
A relic from another time.
A monument to some long dead god.
Parts of this are missing.
This seems mystically aligned to the world.
A sign of animal activity. Leads away.
Ah. You must be behind all the seismic activity.
Panthera auropunctata is looking irritable.
It has been mollified with tributes.
It appears to be a child's plaything.
Pyrotechnic armor!
Surprisingly effective with enough layers.
An interesting choice of materials.
A hardy Thulecite armor.
Now it's an exoskeleton. Ho ho!
A disgusting and magical garment.
It is quite capacious.
Crude plate mail cobbled together from log sections.
A protective shroud that transfers attacks to another dimension.
Not much of an aid now.
A navigational aid. \"Thataway\".
A chance to give direction.
Not much of an aid now.
A navigational aid. \"Thataway\".
A chance to give direction.
Some non-aqueous residue remains after the fire.
The eyebone seems to have been burned entirely.
The flower appears to have been completely burned up.
This used to be something, but now it's just a pile of ash.
It is storing power.
We must be patient.
We'd best not be around when it goes off.
Now where might that lead?
That's taken care of.
The key to that old gateway.
I suspect it is powered by that horrible fuel.
Indeed. It gained power from the key.
It would take much too long to decipher.
An ancient mural of a non-mammalian civilization.
This mural panel is too eroded to decipher.
A dark shadow, or perhaps a substance, overtakes the civilization.
The citizens molt from their exoskeletons in this panel.
The city appears exponentially more prosperous.
It refuses to comply with this world's laws.
A dual inclined plane attached to a lever.
Look at his widdle face! (Ahem!)
He's even more darling in sleep.
That could carry so many books.
Blue eggs and bacon!
Could serve as a suitable diversion.
These seem frivolous.
Medicinal dressings.
Material of great density!
A flying mammal.
Interesting. This weapon appears to be alive.
This nook is actually a dwelling.
Technically edible.
Technically edible.
This is human facial hair.
It's the Caniformia suborder... Beyond that, I cannot say.
Whatever it was, its pelt makes for a fine garment.
My, my! That is thick.
I'm not sleeping on the ground.
I'm not sleeping on the ground.
Apis mellifera. Quite large!
It is not pleased.
Poor bees!
Honey can be harvested from it.
A crude apiary.
It's devoid of honey.
Honey can be harvested from it.
It's not ready for harvesting.
While tame, it has become dependent on its human master.
It appears to be following me.
It looks almost like a Bos Taurus.
It looks cold.
The creature has developed a nasty disposition.
Abundant nourishment has led to an amicable personality.
This one seems lean and athletic.
It's sleeping.
This hat is hideous.
Long follicles harvested from the beefalo.
Very angry Apis mellifera workers!
Appropriate protective equipment is a must!
The natural home of the bee.
A dangerous mine filled with Antophila.
A dangerous mine filled with Culicidae.
The workers ferociously protect her.
Thick Apis mellifera honeycomb.
The Apis mellifera are constructing a new hive.
An Apis mellifera nest of unusual size.
Naturally antibacterial. Could slow food decay if we use it properly.
Quiet! This is a library!
That teddy bear seems to be animated somehow.
That bear is in need of repair.
It's a teddy bear.
Some Ardisia crenata berries, I think.
Roasted Ardisia crenata, just in case.
A variant of Ardisia crenata berries. Good hydration.
Spoilage is a constant threat.
It will require an intervention.
Combustion!
It's afflicted with an agrarian disease beyond my curing.
Hm... The leaves are curling at the edges.
It's an Ardisia crenata bush.
The berries are growing back, slowly.
Ardisia crenata don't do well in extreme heat.
It needs some agricultural attention.
Combustion!
It's afflicted with an agrarian disease beyond my curing.
Hm... The leaves are curling at the edges.
That bush looks ready for harvest.
It will have to wait.
The Ardisia crenata variant has shriveled in the heat.
Prehistoric!
Run awaaay!
I do believe he has starved.
This will safely contain one avian specimen.
He's getting hungry.
He is contained.
I guess I could study the bones.
Shhhhh!
He's looking a bit malnourished.
A simple clap-trap for birds.
It is unfertilized.
Just needs some toast.
A clockwork clergyman.
Augh!
Such exhilaratingly complex technology.
Improvised inflammatory device.
Improvised missile device.
Improvised tranquilizer device.
Improvised electric device.
The gem appears to be sucking energy out anything it touches.
It is cold.
An excellent marker for group coordination.
A detailed technical drawing.
Such a rare and detailed drawing!
This seems to have medicinal properties
Chemistry has altered it.
It is a fungus.
It is dormant this time of day.
It requires hydration before it can fruit again.
Roughly hewn wood boards.
Where did this vessel come from?
Remnants of a life well lived.
Not quite how mum used to make, but it smells superb!
The expurgated version, but it has my favorite: Megascops kennicottii.
What could possibly go wrong?
Dead plants tied together to help me aid living plants.
Warm milk in book form.
Hard to put this one down. It's gripping, frankly.
It is a flat aerofoil.
Microscopic barbs allow for optimal hair retrieval.
The tool of entomologists
At least someone's bundled up out here.
Antibacterial wrapping for food preservation.
A sentient lagomorph.
Reduced to ash.
Camouflage
Lepidopterous lipids?
A colorful lepidopteran.
It is captured.
Who knew butterflies made such nice baked goods?
Wings from a captured butterfly.
Cathartes, of course.
A young barrel cactus.
Desperate times, desperate measures.
Reminds me of Burroughs. A favorite at the library.
I'm not sure it's been prepared properly.
Delightfully devoid of spines.
The fire has almost self-extinguished.
A camp fire.
That fire is burning at an alarming rate.
The fire could use some more fuel.
A perfectly average fire.
It can be re-lit.
Serinus canaria. A historically useful sentinel species.
Serinus canaria. We ought never enter a cave without one.
Oh, dear.
A festive bag for seasonal treats.
I'm no rabologist.
Daucus carota. Edible, and delicious.
Daucus carota, roasted to perfection.
Daucus carota is a root vegetable.
Seed of Daucus carota.
Can we have nothing decent?
The destruction of knowledge is such a difficult thing to stomach.
Ah! A proper desk! Just look at the finish on that wood!
A sort of a wildcat. Handsome fellow.
Looks used up.
An excellent hollow for a den.
Not quite like Crockett's, but it'll do.
It looks as though it can be moved.
We must clear the surrounding boulders first.
All of them are genetically identical.
I do not believe this one can be restored.
Somewhat better.
The seeds must have fallen down a sinkhole.
The placement of that rock looks intentional.
Much too crowded for my liking.
Perhaps when I am better prepared.
The subterranean world awaits.
The passage has been obstructed.
With all those people? It's bound to be cacophony.
Perhaps later.
Maybe I should go back up for some fresh air.
A lovely ornamental plant.
It's mostly carbon and ash.
The magician's unfinished projects?
The magician's unfinished projects?
The magician's unfinished projects?
Quite expressive!
A decorative stone carving of a bishop chess piece.
It seems magic is afoot.
An anatomical study of those strange beasts.
Artist's interpretation of mythical Diptera.
The king is, by all measures, a liability to everyone on the board.
It is a commonly held belief that art imitates life.
A knight, in service to the king. Or perhaps the queen.
It seems magic is afoot.
Bust of Alces canadensis.
In chess, the queen is by far the most strategically formidable.
Pawns that journey to the seat of power can be quite dangerous.
I hope this does not have a bad influence on the children.
Represents the protective walls of the king's castle.
It seems magic is afoot.
A motile storage chest.
Oculus Mysterium.
The oculus is inactive.
The fire has almost self-extinguished.
A rather strange, magical fire pit.
That fire is burning at an alarming rate.
The fire could use some more fuel.
A perfectly unusual fire.
It can be re-lit.
The fire has almost self-extinguished.
A fire pit. It's chilly.
That fire is burning at an alarming rate.
The fire could use some more fuel, whatever fuel it takes.
A fire. Of some kind.
It can be re-lit.
East.
The coordinates remain unknown.
North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
Mandragora officinarum, cooked in the name of discovery.
It is slightly more appetizing when cooked.
It's still a little bit poisonous.
It is slightly more appetizing when cooked.
Now it's truly derelict.
It's got a bit to go before it's ready.
Almost done!
Supper time!
It looks derelict when it's not cooking something.
A flexible torso appendage.
Zea mays, a great staple food.
Popped corn!
These maize seeds will grow in many climates.
A perfect hollow for nesting animals.
What a darling Diptera juvenile!
How do you maintain flight, dear?
Now it feels like home.
I could just squish that widdle face.
What a handsome poult you are!
Who's the sweetest little Canis lupus?
Corvus brachyrhynchos.
A perfectly handsome specimen.
Some grass cuttings.
This won't last long.
Some rush cuttings.
Some smoothed rock slabs.
I'm not sure that's good to eat.
The tree is burning.
A carbonized tree.
It has been harvested.
Fagales of some kind. It bears fruit when fully grown.
That is no tree I've seen before!
Its antler has grown in for winter.
It has shed its antler for the warmer months.
Laurasiatheria!
I feel a vague sense of accomplishment.
It looks like a key, but it's quite brittle.
The poor creature has been forcibly fused to a magic gem.
A tuft of a graminoid.
Much more effective than reading glasses.
Unhygienic!
The dial is moving faintly.
It is a magitechnical homing device.
Here we are!
This is definitely the right track.
Must be getting close.
It will need some work before it can function.
It simply needs a key now.
Ah. The beauty of functionality.
This rod could be useful!
The longer the dragon, the better the luck.
It's some kind of mythical variant of a Diptera.

A job well done.
Fits comfortably in my pocket.
A very secure wall.
My pockets must be bigger on the inside.
That is quite secure.
I'll carry them. My strong backbone always was my best asset.
Fire was its weakness.
That offers some protection.
Deployable pickets.
Odobenus rosmarus; Gaelic variety.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot?
It has been deserted for now.
Some kind of temporary habitation.
This would be useful for scrimshaw.
Hmm, now it reminds me of a very different famous book.
It used to be a wardrobe.
This reminds me of a famous book.
Domesticating this Canis will be an entertaining challenge.
I had best keep my distance.
A toy for children.
Citrullus lanatus.
That's certainly one thing you could do with a watermelon.
The melon is entirely encased in an ice lattice.
Beautifully grilled.
Plant them to grow a lanatus.
You're not making trouble, are you %s?
\"By Hel's fire\" is just a turn of phrase, dear.
Ah, greetings dear %s!
%s, I told you not to run with spears. Tsk.
Your saga ends here, %s!
I appreciate your commitment to group survival, %s.
Anachronistic drivel.
Now we just require rope to secure it in place.
Up to your old tricks, are you %s?
Lighting fires are we now, %s? Tread carefully.
Ah, greetings dear %s!
Stings, doesn't it dear? Let me fetch you a heart.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... you're dead!
There's good in you, %s.
I'm not letting THAT in MY library!
That's enough funny business, young arachnid.
Who gave you matches, %s?
Ah, greetings dear %s!
Poor dear. We'll get you a nice colored bandage once you're revived.
Someone needs to teach you some manners, %s!
You're a sweet boy, %s.
That is a most unusual skull.
%s! That's enough out of you, young lady!
Who gave you flammable materials, %s?
Ah, greetings dear %s!
Goodness, this just won't do. Let me find you a heart, %s.
Someone needs to teach you some manners, %s!
You're a dear, %s. And so uniquely qualified to handle specters!
His body language says everything.
Don't cry to me when you burn yourself, dear.
Ah, the mime lad. Greetings, dear %s!
Poor dear. %s needs a heart to anchor him to this plane.
They'll tell tales of your defeat, %s!
You're a fine young man, %s.
Oh no. No, no, no. This won't do at all.
This may prove useful.
Perhaps something useful lies inside?
An instrument for developing pain compliance.
%s's immoral acts are putting holes in my multiverse speculations.
Book burnings are quite gauche, %s.
Ah, greetings %s! Fancy seeing you here.
All our self-help books will finally be put to use, hmm %s?
I am my own worst critic!
Our knowledge comes in handy, doesn't it, %s?
You like to test boundaries, don't you dear?
What have I said about lighting fires, dear?
Ah, greetings dear %s!
If you cross your ghosteyes they'll get stuck like that, dear.
You WILL respect your elders, %s!
You're doing so well, %s.
I'll pull you back to base by the ear if I have to, %s.
%s needs a stern talking to.
Greetings, dear %s! How are your theorems coming?
Didn't I tell you to wear a jacket? I'll get the hearts...
It appears we've entered a battle of the wits, %s!
You may know a thing or two after all, scientist!
I ought to teach the children how to pick up a stitch.
I can't read any measurements from that husk.
Measure before you act.
What a delightful little individual.
Just like holidays at the library!
The perfect stir stick for hot cup of tea.
An object with negligible temporal drag.
Such expertly prepared raspberry filling!
\"Plum\" is a 17th century term for \"fruit\", dear.
Pair it with a good book and you've a cure for the winter blues.
A small enchantment keeps it a pleasant temperature.
I've always harbored a weakness for good 'nog.
Careful with it now, dear.
I'm of the opinion that one can never overdecorate.
Electrical currents do have a certain appeal, don't they?
Oh gracious, not again.
Not to worry. We can still celebrate.
Lovely job on the tree, dears.
It'd surely snap under the weight of ornaments.
Not to worry. We can still celebrate.
Let's grow a proper tree, shall we?
I will not tolerate such behavior, %s.
Was that fire intentional, %s?
Ah, greetings dear %s!
%s acts tough, but he needs my help. A heart should do it.
That's it, %s! I'm taking my glasses off!
Excellent work, %s. You're a fast learner.
Careful, %s. You know what paper pulp is made of, don't you?
Poor dear never mentioned he was afflicted by Castorthropy.
I'll add \"Castorthrope\" to my endangered species list.
Keep lighting fires if you want to get burnt, dear.
Ah, greetings dear %s!
What did I say about playing with axes? Let's get you a heart.
I will defend myself from you, foul cad!
Excellent work, %s.
It would be best to stay away from that.
Reminds me of the Anglerfish.
Worm attack!
The sleeping Megadrilacea Oraduos.
Concentric rings of teeth for rapid ingestion.
It will only last a few trips.
It's softer than I would've thought.
This one is purely vegetable.
Reminds me of the Anglerfish.
What devilishness is that robot up to?
Do be careful when trying to destroy all life, dear.
Ah, the automaton. Greetings, dear %s!
Fascinating. %s indeed has a specter, and it lingers still.
The binary is simple, %s... On, or OFF.
I appreciate your commitment to group survival, %s.
This amulet is glowing at the mid 530 nanometer wavelength.
Perhaps it is similar to citrine.
The geography of this place is less unknown each day.
Luckily the star is a manageable size.
A rare occurrence. I don't know what that is.
Seems it's about to ignite from the heat.
I can't see in the dark.
Al dente.
Ughhhh, nooo... I don't feel good.
I've already got one!
I can't place anything from atop this big lout!
That's way better than some dumb dresses!
Nah, too much effort.
Stop hogging it, I wanna dress up too!
I'm not too big on cooking.
Hey! What're you making? Can I have it?
It's all the way over thereeeee!
But what should I even draw??
Ugh, just come back already! Geez!
It's busyyyy.
It's not working.
They won't fully appreciate my gift.
Awww, we already know that one!
Noooope!
I'm not wasting this on them!
Ughh, it doesn't need this! It needs a living log!
Ughh, it doesn't need this! It needs a mushroom!
I can cram it in there but I dunno if I could get it back out.
I'd like to see someone try to sculpt with that!
I don't have to jam stuff into every hole I see!
Not right now. It's sleeping.
Naw, can't make it fit.
It's the wrong rock!
Nah. Skeleton's not right.
Hurry uppp! I have a sweet present for you!
They won't fully appreciate my gift.
They can't carry any more things.
I could leave it under their pillow...?
Hurry uppp! I have a sweet present for you!
They won't fully appreciate my gift.
They can't carry any more things.
I could leave it under their pillow...?
They beat me to the hairy beast. Maybe it's for the best.
I'll ride it when it settles down.
We carried it all this way and it's not even the right one!
Make someone else do it!
There must be something good in there if you want it so bad!
I'll ride it when it settles down.
Maybe I should wait for it to be distracted...
Nu-uh.
It's already shaved!
It's full already.
I'll use it after they're done.
They won't let me.
Ugh, whatever, I didn't wanna know anyway.
I knowwwww that already, geez!
What the... this map isn't right at all!
But that big ugly thing is on my tail!
Darn thing won't work!
I'm not just gonna wrap air!
I can't write on it.
I wanna write when you're done!
I can'tttttt.
Move, arrow! MOVE!
I DID IT!
You win THIS time, Maxwell.
The ground's cracking!
Tread carefully!
Earthquake!
Hey, I gotcha something!
Dinnertime!
Great Antlion! Take this tribute, or whatever.
I probably shouldn't be here.
This seems dangerous!
What was that?!
oOoOooOo!!
Aaaah! Pokey bugs!
Stupid boomerang!
I wish I'd let it go up in flames...
\nI think I can fix this!
I better protect my head!
I'm not afraid of you!
OUCH! You jerk!
The cold! It burns!
Arrgh the needle is stuck!
I'm missing something.
Uh oh!
That sounded like a big mean monster man!
Pfft. Fire would've worked just as well.
Night is coming. I need fire!
Yum!
How would I even eat that!
Ugh! Nasty!
That tasted terrible!
That was kinda gross.
Eeeew, no way!
Ughhh!
Exercise... sucks!
Hnnfhg!
Why am I doing this...?!
Oooof!!
Unghhh!
There's... no way this is worth it!
My arms feel like they're on fire!
Ughhhh! I'm all sweaty!
This... is... the worst...
I can feel the burn... I hate it!
Where'd I put my lighter!?
Oh, I can see! I thought I'd gone blind.
Stupid thing broke!
I'm free! Time for fires!
Burn... It all must burn...
So much information!
The heat is too intense!
Show yourself!
I need food!
I'll find you!
Ohh... he got away.
Boooo, I lost track of him in the mud.
It looks slightly happier.
I can only carry so much!!
Aww man, here come those weird goat things!
I'm NOT fighting THAT.
Why couldn't it just stay dead?!
Argh, my little head!
Tee hee!
Pretty!
Oops!
I made a fire!
Burn!
I can't help myself!
I'm safe from the sky-fire.
Boo, that was boring.
Get away, you bloodsucking jerks!
This beast is looking pretty bad.
I'm not leaving now!
That dumb box can wait!
It's not time for a siesta, it's time for fighting!
No time for sleep, there's fighting to do!
Who would go inside when there's a great ball of fire in the sky?
Too spooky down here to sleep.
I can't take a siesta while my tummy is grumbling!
My tummy is grumbling, I can't sleep!
I gotta get down from this big oaf before opening that!
I couldn't get comfortable there.
I'd really rather be inside.
It's just the collapsing that concerns me.
Why? This is way better.
Like lighting a barrel of fish on fire.
No! Bad birdy!
Something weird is happening...!
Ugh, put it back!
That sound probably doesn't mean good things.
Hey! That's not fair!
That was useful, even if it didn't have anything about fires.
Aw, everything I killed is back!
Rude.
That did it!
You're good for something besides burning after all.
Gross, ew! Bones!
Ugh, this is the WORST!
Ouch!
Awww! I liked that thing.
Ughh! But I was winning!
Don't even think about running, toad!
Still got my lighter!
My precious light is gone!
Didja miss me?! Haha!
Aah!
Gah! That stung ya jerk!
This could be bad!
I hate it!
I'll have to burn these clothes!
I do NOT wanna see what made that sound!
You're deer meat!
It's you or me!
Stupid pig!
Get over here!
Grrrrar!
Ew, kill iiiit!
That's what I thought!
Get back here, pork chop!
I'll get you next time!
Bleh. I'll kill him later.
Not so tough now!
So, what happened to you?
Looks flammable.
I don't want to mess with that.
It's burning a hole in my pocket. Heh.
Looks flammable.
Ugh, it's weird!
Burning is still an option.
I hate that arrow!
Hey there, tree seed.
Looks like you won't become a tree after all.
You'll be a real tree soon.
Maybe that leads home.
I have no idea what it does, but it feels good to wear it!
The dead can't get through here.
Oooo! An afterlife intercom.
The dead can't get through here.
Drat, won't burn.
It leads to my new friend.
What do you want?!
There's gonna be tremors in our future.
You're in a good mood.
Buncha junk.
Yay! More FIRE!!!
A waste of flammable materials.
If you're gonna fight you might as well be protected.
Human beings probably shouldn't wear this.
Can't hit me in this thing!
Oh, ick! Ick! Ick! Ick! Eeeeeewwwwww!
Less defense! More offense!
Now I can take on the world!
Like being wrapped in smoke.
It said \"Don't play with matches\", but the \"Don't\" is crossed out now.
Less reading! More burning!
I could doodle something rude here.
It said \"Don't play with matches\", but the \"Don't\" is crossed out now.
Less reading! More burning!
I could doodle something rude here.
Leftovers from a fire. I wish it was still here.
I bet that eye thing was quite a sight wreathed in fire!
I wish I saw the way that weird flower burned.
I wish this thing was still burning, whatever it was.
Something weird's going on.
I'll come back another time.
Is it gonna explode?!
Why would anyone want to live down here?
It lit up!
The horns make it really easy to turn.
Ew, creepy.
It's somehow even creepier when it's on.
It's in some other language.
It's got a picture of some gross looking people.
Can't tell what that was a picture of.
I think someone spilled ink on this picture.
Oh, gross! The people're losing their skin in this one!
It's just a picture of a city.
Eerily lifelike.
It's very sharp.
Even the babies are ugly.
WAKE UP!
You could fit like a million lighters in here.
The yellow mucus-y part is gross, but the bacon is great!
That's just asking to be popped.
I could fill them with flammable gas.
Eww, no!
It's too hard to break!
Cute little guy!
That thing's great for batting at enemies.
What would happen if I dropped a match in there?
Yuck!
Still yuck!
Clean up your gross hair guys! Ugh!
Whoa! Niiiice bear...
It's like swimming in fur.
It's fur all the way down.
It's too frilly.
Musty.
It's fat, but that stinger looks dangerous.
Pocket full of bees!
Smoked you out!
Yay! Let's steal honey!
Come on fat bees, make honey!
Nothing to see here.
Yay! Let's steal honey!
Patience.
It's lost the fire from its heart.
Er, are you following me?
What a disgusting, hairy beast!
Ha! He's all naked now!
I can see fire in its eyes.
You need to burn some calories.
Let's go!
They look even dumber when they're sleeping.
Beast hair to go over people hair!
Ha! Its owner is probably naked somewhere. Or dead.
Puffy flying jerk!
This will keep the pokeys off of me.
It's full of bees!
Bees inside. Should've put some fire in there for good measure.
Mosquitoes inside. They don't sound happy.
No amount of honey is worth THAT!
It all came from a bee's butt.
Ew, burn it before it gets any bigger!
Dare you guys to smack it with a hammer.
That's none of my beeswax.
Is it New Year's Eve? Are there FIREWORKS?!
Help me, Bernie!
I need to fix Bernie up.
My childhood buddy - Bernie!
Red berries taste the best.
Red berries with fire somehow taste even better.
Mmm. They pop in your mouth.
Fire improves everything.
Eat poop, stupid plant!
Yes!! Burn!!
Burn the sick!
Blech. You smell.
Mmmmm. Berries.
But I want more berries!
All dried out. Primed for fire!
Did I say you could stop growing?!
Yes!! Burn!!
Burn the sick!
Blech. You smell.
Ready for picking!
Make mooooore!
It's burning up.
What in the world!
Aaah! Set it on fire!
At least he's quiet now.
Bird prison!
What's all the fuss about?
Ha! Gotcha now!
That should probably be cleaned up.
Stupid bird. Wake up!
He won't be quiet!
Gonna catch those creepy birds.
It smells like a bird's butt.
Yuck. The yellow part is all runny.
It's a bishop!
Owwww!
Ahhh!
That's my favorite thing in the whole wide world.
Good practice for blowing into a fire.
Tranquilized things are easier to light on fire.
Lightning is sort of like fire.
Boo to this.
Ugh. This one is ugly.
That's not an eyeball! It's a rock!
This will save some experimentation.
Woah. It doesn't burn!!
It smells like a gym sock!
Transformed by fire!
Dumb mushroom.
Hey! You! Get up here!
Maybe it will return some day.
Boards. They'll burn, same as other wood.
Must. Resist. Urge. To. Burn.
I don't think they make good tinder.
Just add fire to food and voila!
Less reading, more burning!
That's my favorite book!
Ughh, who cares?
Bo-oring!
Looks like kindling to me!
It's not the most exciting weapon.
It smells like burnt hair.
Doesn't fit over Webber's big head.
Now I can burn a bunch of things in one go!
We could hide some gross things, I guess.
Ugh. They look so stupid.
Too passive!
Tasty, and just a little bit insecty.
Flutter away, butterfly!
I want to squish it.
Heehee, look at that butterfly stuck in the muffin.
No more flying for that butterfly!
Your neck is gross.
Spines! My weakness! How did you know?
We'll call it a tie.
Yet another flower.
It still looks dangerous.
It seems fine now.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
I like fire.
BURN! BURN FASTER!
This fire is small and boring.
Burn!
Awww. It's all over.
If it kicks the bucket I'm outta here.
You still breathing? Just checking.
Is that infectious? We should burn it.
I'm gonna stuff so much candy in there!
It's way easier to cover ground with this!
Yuck. It's all vegetabley.
Still vegetabley, but better for having been in fire.
Maybe its special carrot friend is in the ground.
Seeds for a yucky orange vegetable.
Yes!!
Scouts don't need maps, anyway.
I guess I could show everyone where I've been.
Here, kitty!
It's all dried up and ready for burning.
I wouldn't burn it while someone lives there.
Cuddly hat.
Let's just smash it up.
I can't get up there!
Bananas!
That's all I wanted!
Yum!
Looks burnable!
Who plugged that hole?
There's too many people down there.
I don't want to go in that gross hole!
I hope there's lava down there somewhere.
Who plugged that hole?
There's too many people up there.
It's cooler down here, anyway.
It's too dark and stuffy down here.
Looks flammable.
Mmmm. Smells like fire.
Dead windup horsey.
Dead windup priest.
Dead windup castle.
Those are some pointy teeth.
Just some dumb bishop piece.
I don't wanna see what comes outta that!
We kicked its butt.
I think... I think I understand art.
I'm not afraid of that guy. He doesn't even have arms!
Ouchhh! I think I chipped a tooth.
A horse with no butt.
I don't wanna see what comes outta that!
Looks as dumb as the real thing.
Ewww, she doesn't have a head!
What sort of peasant doesn't have a torch?!
I prefer smokey fires.
That one looks like it could do some damage.
I don't wanna see what comes outta that!
He's so fuzzy!
It's rude to stare.
At least it's not looking at me anymore.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
I like fire of all kinds.
BURN! BURN FASTER! AND BLUER!
This fire is small and boring.
Burn!
Awww. It's all over.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
I could watch it for hours, even though it's cold.
BURN! BURN FASTER! AND BLUER!
This fire is small and boring. And blue.
Burn!
Make the fire come back!
East!
Can't get a reading.
North!
Northeast!
Northwest!
South!
Southeast!
Southwest!
West...
The fire didn't get rid of its face. Gives me the willies.
Unseasoned meat... great.
It's still gross.
Gonna need a lot of appetizers to survive out here!
At least it went out in a blaze of glory.
The fire still has quite a bit of work to do.
The fire is doing its thing!
Fire makes everything better. Mmm!
All food must be cleansed with fire.
I've kept stranger things than that.
A sweet vegetable, yum!
Ooh, this one explodes when it goes in fire!
Seeds for my favorite explosive vegetable.
Is there anything cute in there??
We were made for each other.
Aww, I could just squish your gross lil face!
You're the perfect lapwarmer.
Look at those creepy little eyes. Aww.
I could just eat you up.
Hah, you don't even know you're smelly.
I think it's waiting for me to die.
Not so smart now, are you?
Cut grass, ready for burning. Or maybe crafting.
Blah, tastes like sawdust.
Cut reeds, ready for burning. Or maybe crafting.
Perfectly squared for maximum enjoyment.
Fire didn't cure this dish of being nasty.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
One less tree in the world.
It looks like it would burn well.
A fire would set'em straight.
Don't think that horn makes you special, deer.
I wish everyone'd stop fawning over that smelly thing!
Holy crap!
Stop staring at me!
It's a big, weird antler.
Marginally better smelling than most animals here.
What a sorry looking piece of... grass?
Not very stylish.
Who just leaves dirt lying around in the forest?
It's making some kind of noise.
It's full of electrical junk.
Gah! Enough with the beeping!
This thing is getting noisier.
Must be close!
Not sure what this does. Doesn't seem like it's fiery things.
Just needs to be unlocked with a key. Not fire, unfortunately.
It's whirring now!
I'll make something out of it.
Aww, I always get caught in the middle!
It's filled with fire!
I'm not sure why you'd want something that DOESN'T burn...
Let's turn it back on!
That's certainly a look.
I think I'm in love.
Stick another gem in there!
It looks sort of like a fire!
It looks more like a fruit that's been in a fire now.
Seeds for that fire-looking fruit.
Sooo ferocious!
Fire fruit in a pie? Oh boy!
I wanna be the caboose!
Oooooooh! I LIKE those.
Bang on the drum all day!
Hmm... Satisfy hunger, or bang on the drum?
What's the matter, got no dirt?
What's the matter, got no dirt?
What's the matter, got no dirt?
What's the matter, got no dirt?
What's the matter, got no dirt?
Ew, stinky!
Yuck, it smells just as bad cooked!
Smelly seeds for a smelly fruit.
Smells like rabbit butt.
Smells like rabbit butt.
I don't like the look it's giving me!
Fire improves everything.
Definitely not a bird.
Using fire on it made it a tastier eggplant.
Will these seeds make a plant or baby bird?
Alright, alright, so I was wrong about the hand!
I'm telling you, there's a monsterhand under that thing!
Not as good as a fire, but at least we won't be in the dark.
Just a bunch of dumb flowers.
We're gonna be in the dark soon.
Those need replacing.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
One less tree in the world.
It looks like it would burn well.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
One less tree in the world.
Die in a fire!
Keeps the rain out your eyes and in someone else's.
They spread like fire.
I wish it lit stuff on fire.
It's no good until it's been placed.
It was a nice finale.
Sigh. It's a pile of dirt.
Hurry up, dirtpile. Feed me!
Stupid thing needs poop.
I dunno... it could put out some fires...
A phoenix reborn!
So what does the feather do again?
Canary feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Crow feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Redbird feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Snowbird feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
She looks scared half to death.
I'm not painting that.
I guess we could pen stuff in with it.
No point just leaving it on the ground.
No point just leaving it on the ground.
A bucket full of nasty.
Light'em up!
I wish they didn't run away!
They're like little fires in my pocket!
I actually kind of like that one.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
I could watch it for hours.
BURN! BURN FASTER!
This fire is small and boring.
Burn!
Make the fire come back!
That's my absolute favorite toy.
Almost out.
And stay off!
I wish you'd shut your lid and stop putting out fires.
Slippery fishy!
Fishing for the answer with a hook, line and sinker.
What you see is what you get. Sticks of fish.
Convenient taco-grip.
Less slippery now that it's found fire.
The poor man's fire-starter.
I don't have time to waste on flowers.
I'd like to burn this flower in particular.
A halo of flowers. Too bad it's not a burning halo of flowers.
I'd rather a bowl of flames.
It's burning inside.
Ugh, that smells terrible.
Looks like good kindling.
Fuel for the fire.
Sports are hard.
It's just nasty old bits of bones!
Looks passable.
That looks absolutely ridiculous.
Needs more gross old bits.
Showed him!
He's too damp to burn.
They're cute when they're sleeping.
If you close your eyes it's a little easier to get it down.
It still twitches every now and then. Freaky.
The fire made it stop twitching. Fire is the best.
Yum, fruit!
Black and white and fuzzy all over!
Lookit this big dumb lawn ornament!
At least it doesn't smell anymore.
These must make them move.
It's so empty!
I wonder how they hover?
You can't kill what's already dead.
It's for me right?!
Ribbons burn real good!
See? Fire solves everything.
I can't believe that worked!
It's fuzzy! And slimy...
I wonder if it burns...
Why does everything have to be a flower?!
It's goopy and weird.
They're so small!
It's fuzzy with electricity. Yuck.
What a great look!
It won't light trees on fire, but at least it's shiny.
It won't light rocks on fire, but at least it's shiny.
It won't light the ground on fire, but at least it's shiny.
It won't make flaming pits, but at least it's shiny.
What should we spend it on??
So snuggly!
It needs poop.
Fire! Wooo!
Burn the sick!
Blech. You smell.
It's a flammable tuft of grass.
Grass stubble is kind of useless.
Nice, dry, and ready to burn!
Double ew!
Ew.
Pretty as can be!
I feel my mind opening when I wear it.
This one feels really light.
A big dumb rock.
It won't start a fire but I guess it's still useful.
Boring!
It's been transformed by fire!
Stupid mushroom.
Hey! You! Get up here!
Maybe it will return some day.
Holy moley, that's tasty!
It burns like normal poop.
Oooooooooh! Shiny!
That's wayyyy better than a regular apple!
Yesssss! Lollipops!
I'm gonna need about a dozen of these.
Do people actually eat these or are they just a bad joke?
Ewwww it's corn flavored!
Eww! I hate black licorice!
These are a meow-uthful.
Hey Wolfgang, eat one and tell us what it is!
Burn them!!!
Yesssss! Lollipops!
Why does something so yummy have to look so gross!
Pleased to meat you!
I prefer sharp implements.
I wonder if it'd burn as nicely as actual flowers do.
It burns! But, where's the fire?
It's stone cold.
Frozen solid.
A fire would liven this thing up!
Look at how it glows!
No flame, no real heat... what fun is that?
That bee's head looks kinda tasty, doesn't it?
I'm gonna burn it.
Hahaha, yesss!
Less reading! More burning!
I should burn something into it.
Sweet and delicious!
It's waxy.
Fire, ham and honey go well together.
Honey-covered morsels that have met my friend, fire.
I can hear those hairy beasts inside.
Now that's my kind of heat!
What a jerk!
Gross.
Uh oh, I don't like the look of that.
It's sharp. I like it!
What's your angle?
It's too wet to burn.
It's still too wet to burn.
Chilly.
That is the opposite of fire.
Well, soooometimes cold things are okay.
It's a real mood dampener.
Gross! Cold!
Fuzzy backpack!
Booooring.
Am I seeing things?
Doesn't look flammable. How boring.
Why didn't anyone tell me I had ashes on my face?
Wham, bam, jam! Thank you, ma'am.
Nothing better than a handful of jellybeans.
Meat and fire, now with a stick!
I like the cut of that bee's jib.
Buzz!
A lump of coal would be really useful, actually!
Ha! I wouldn't wanna get smacked with that thing!
Nothing says \"Open Me\" quite like a lock!!
It's a pony!
It looks pretty worn down.
We will be great friends!
He sure looks warm...
Stay back, you big jerk!
The holidays came early this year!
Fire is not meant to be contained like this!
Why can't we be friends?
Aw, it lost its fiery personality.
I think a fire is trying to escape.
It has a chill.
That egg looks happy.
My own little burninator.
She's... perfect.
I think she wants some burnings.
I can see her ribs!
I hope she's not a biter.
Cool drool, literally.
The coolest drool!
Yes! Yessss!
Oh great, another stinkin' rock!
He looks flammable!
He looks flammable!
A gross, crusty plant.
Don't you dare stick that in me!
It's called a \"lightbulb\" but it's kinda heavy.
It's my lucky lighter!
You're crazy!
Bouncy goat.
I heard lightning when I held it to my ear.
Aww, all glow but no fire.
All the lightning goes here!
He looks tasty.
It looks upset.
It might be alive, but it'll still burn.
Burn, log, buuuurn!
Wood! So flammable! Hooray!
I don't think I'm supposed to spend this.
We could be good friends, you and I.
I should burn that thing before it reaches full ugliness.
I bet a quick fire would take care of this.
Gross! It's so meaty!
He looks scared half to death.
Why did this plant have a face?
The face doesn't wash away!!
Now that's just creepy!
The fire made this plant guy a lot quieter.
That's not a normal plant.
The rabbits lost that argument.
Nothing's on it? I can burn it then, right?
It's heavy!
I guess we just... plant it? In the dirt?
That makes no sense!
I wonder if the rest burnt down.
What sort of bush doesn't burn?!
The worst kind of tree. The non-flammable kind.
Burn, thorns!
It looks sharp.
Those thorns hurt!
It's all plant-y.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
Not so spiky now, are you?
It looks dangerous!
He's so condescending.
He sure likes to talk.
These are no fun. They light themselves.
It just needs a key.
I like more exciting music.
Looks sticky.
This could be made better with FIRE!
Meat made into spheres and improved with fire.
Maybe the fire wasn't the best drying method...
It's ready!
Come on meat, dry already!
Forget the rain! Dry!
I want to hang some meat!
Chewy, but satisfying.
Eww, it's all swampy.
Double whammy!
That's what you get for being so stinky!
It's true, no one cares.
No one would care if this burned down.
It's not real fire, but it's still pretty fun.
No fun, making me exercise to stay cool!
Haha oh man, who drew THAT?
Looks kinda bare.
It's like a sign, but smaller.
Poor thing. Trapped in this maze.
I want big horns like that!
I wonder if the rings are an indication of age.
Coming up for a peek!
Out of the ground, into the fire.
Hiding from the light, huh?
I'm not sure about this...
It burrows away from the sun's skyfire. Unnatural.
Joke's on you! I can burn this poo.
What a wonderfully flammable home.
Noodles, meat and clumps of hair. Nasty.
Gross. It's full of hairs.
It's dry and smells strange.
Oh look, a bunch of smashed up rocks!
It's expecting something from me.
Ughh! It's doing the exact opposite of burning!
Hurry up already, stupid rock!
That's obviously completely wrong.
Doesn't work down here.
What the heck? I can still see the moon!
That's as full as it gets.
A new moon! Great, I hated the old one!
The moon's outta here!
The moon is waxing, unlike me.
Great. A rock with a hole in it.
Just another rock to me.
Oh look! ROCKS! Ughhhhh!
What in the world...
It's huuuuge!
Ugh, it smells like bird butts!
So annoying!
Keep that mouth away from me!
Blood must bubble in currents muggy and thick.
Its feathers are frazzled.
Better it than me.
It's full of dead stuff, I bet.
The vines coil away from my lighter... weird!
It's so useful!
She's gonna blow!
I don't like having my head messed with.
How could that not work?!
A big gross mushroom! Burn it!
Mold problem's taken care of.
It's just a dumb log.
Gross, they're taking over!
Nasty. Let's burn the rot out.
I'm sure fire would fix that.
There's mushrooms growing in it now.
Geez, who even needs that many mushrooms?
C'mon, you saw that coming.
This dumb mushroom's not lighting up.
Not as nice as a warm fire.
Now what?
I've got a few ideas on how to light it. Heh heh.
Pfft, well that was a bright idea.
It's spreading junk everywhere.
Gross. It smells like leprechaun butt.
Ew, I don't want to get too close.
Gross. It's all mushroomy.
Ack! It stinks!
Gross. This tree is sick all over.
That one got what it deserves.
It's like fire, but purple!
Eww, it's still warm!
Light without fire is unnatural.
Looks normal to me.
I guess it's nearly over.
I don't think it's working.
It's almost humming.
I think it's turning off.
It's warning me.
The fuel is coming to life!
It'd be way cooler if it was on fire...
It's like dreams that can hurt real things!
There are tiny explosions trapped inside.
It's a bunch of water.
I can do the pyrotechnics too!
It's glittery and mesmerizing, like a fire!
Gotta hold it with my sleeve so my hands don't get cold.
It picks up burning materials!
It'll make your fingers tingle.
It's a rock. Ugh!
It gives me a headache.
Kind of tacky.
Music is boring.
I bet it'd burn!
Run away, tiny dancers.
Evil bird! Get away from those yummy berries!
It's a big ol' fan.
Well, that's burned now.
What do we have to do now?
I don't even like gobblers!
Tasty things, sealed with fire.
Stupid flowers. They're almost useless.
Ew, they're sticky.
How am I supposed to burn it now?
Gross! Let's burn it.
It's very pointy.
I like his attitude!
It's a backpack made out of butts!
It can always get worse, I guess.
I guess I have it alright.
Nice redecorating job!
He's doing pig things in there.
These pigs have questionable taste in architecture.
You jerk! Let me in!
Blech. What a slob.
I wonder how they taste.
Ick. It's following me.
Ugh. They're fragrant.
He's not the boss of me!
Bring it on, piggie!
Ha ha. A pig's butt.
It smells terrible!
These pigs sure know how to have a good time.
Hey there, tree seed.
You'll be a real tree soon.
Three times the pointiness.
Eww, it's all slimy.
Fire makes everything better.
I'd eat it if I had to.
Hurry up, you stupid plant!
Oh boy. Vegetables.
It's crackly and dry. Good kindling!
Why, %s... that fire in your eyes!
BUUURN!
Hi %s!
I better get a heart for %s.
Burn the murderer!
Who do ghosts call? %s!
Is it supposed to have this many parts?
Fire always makes things better.
Looks like the part from inside the fruit.
This pond will definitely not ignite. How dull.
It must need a lot of water.
Ew. Nasty. But useful.
I'd rather burn them.
I wonder if it is flammable.
I wonder what would happen if I applied fire.
Cookies!!!
Fire on the outside turned out pretty well.
Fire on the inside is amazing!
Seeds for fire's best vegetable-friend... the pumpkin.
Has science gone too far?
Weird!
Some sort of weird rock.
He looks tasty.
I have him right where I want him!
Stupid rabbits. Come out so I can eat you.
Stupid rabbits must be stuck down there.
Ha! Good result.
Ugh. Stupid rabbits.
That'll do the trick.
Anything to keep the water away.
Take that, rain!
Rain is the anti-fire. Boo!
Vegetables. So many vegetables.
What's it even for?
So pretty!
Anything with a fire in it is okay by me.
This one's got fire in its eye!
What a great color!
I like the color.
It's been transformed by fire!
Pretty!
Hey! You! Get up here!
Maybe it will return some day.
Burn! Yeah!
It's a burnable clump of reeds.
It's just reed stubble.
Vests are so in.
Old furniture.
There's no learning from that now.
Even I don't know everything... yet.
There's no learning from that now.
Even I don't know everything... yet.
Now it's dark and not very powerful.
A dark and powerful energy radiates from it.
Double, double toil and... oh. It's burned.
I can use the hat like a cauldron!
Our policy was canceled.
That's our insurance policy.
I'll touch it when I'm good and ready.
I expected it to be blacker.
A redbird. The color of fire, but not a phoenix.
It's cozy in my pocket.
It looks cold out here. I bet it wants a fire.
It's so fluffy.
They look scared half to death.
It's, like, a rock.
What's the point of collecting these again?
We don't have much in common.
I don't think there's any way it'd burn.
As useless as water ever was.
As useless as water ever was.
There's heat in there, just waiting to get out!
The lava is cooling.
A pool of fire!
Aww, it's cooled off.
Just another rock to me.
How am I supposed to burn it now?
How am I supposed to burn it now?
It's a castle!
It has a nasty smile.
What should we tie up??!
Ew! Why? Oh Why?!
It's so sweet!
Broken furniture.
It seems like there's something flowing through it.
This will keep the nasties at bay.
That could probably be fixed up.
A very very old chest.
I think it's judging me.
I bet it stinks under the saddle.
It's so uncomfortable.
Was it worth it? I think it was worth it.
I'm going to raze some villages!
It's a big block of slobbery salt.
Buuurn!
Burn it!
I wonder what these markings mean.
Where'd it go?
Burn! Yeah!
Burn the sick!
Blech. You smell.
It'd be worth it to pick that.
Poor little limp tree.
It's so dry, it's like it WANTS to be on fire.
It's a burning man.
Just burnt straw.
Ha! He thinks he's people!
Ewwwwwwwwwww!
I'm gonna carve a stone butt.
Haha!
Hm... I could make things that DON'T burn?
I guess that's good, too.
Not burnable. Not interested.
Humpty Dumpty's back together again.
Ew! It's wriggling!
The crank doesn't even turn!
Gross. I don't think that was supposed to come off.
It's a marble statue, I guess.
He didn't even say \"thank you\".
Ew! It's wriggling!
That thing looks terrible.
Great, now we've irritated some marble crime boss!
Looks like a bunch of rubble to me.
I'm more used to destroying things than fixing them.
Ew! It's wriggling!
What a creepy load of junk!
Ha, falling to pieces. Rookie mistake.
Farming is boring.
No good for farming now.
Pfft. It'll burn like the rest.
But destruction is so much more fun!
At least something around here can hold it together.
Eww, it's even creepier than the real one.
Oh, ewww! Who would ever touch that?!
Not great for fighting.
Ew! Burn that!
I always set them on fire.
They taught us how to make these in Girl Scouts.
Mmmmmm. Smooth.
I hope you at least went out in a blaze of glory.
I've got a headache just looking at it.
The fire of %s's life was extinguished by %s.
The fire of %s's life was extinguished by %s.
The fire of %s's life was extinguished by %s.
The fire of %s's life was extinguished by %s.
Trading diagrams is for dorks.
Ooooh, spooky!
Who's ready for a nap!
Do they have little fires in their bellies?
Eeewwwww, it's still alive!
Eeewwwww, it's still alive!
I want to blow it up!
It's perfectly head-shaped.
I should burn them out.
I love this stuff!
Heh. It broke.
Not quite a phoenix, but still cute. I guess.
Are you hungry?
Okay, okay! I get it, you're hungry.
This could be made better with FIRE!
Chewy, but satisfying.
Kaboom!
I don't like your face!
That looks good for jabbin'!
I prefer a flame, but to each her own.
Ha! Showed you!
He's nasty. I should kill him.
I could take him.
That's just nasty.
Tons of tiny disgusting spiders.
Eeeeew, it's slimy and stinky!
Who's your mommy!
It's full of spiders.
It's full of spiders.
Kill it with fire!
They come from above.
What a frustrating jerk!
Get over here!
He had it coming.
Maybe I could kill it... with FIRE.
Maybe I should just leave that one alone.
At least it's still flammable.
It's like floating fire!
It feels flammable.
It has no idea where it's going.
It feels flammable.
It's like colorful sparks!
It feels flammable.
Boo! Hissss!
It's so beautiful!
Always whirling! Swirling towards destruction!
Gross! I told you we shoulda burned it!
What's a weird table doing out here? Let's burn it!
Rocks are boring.
More boring rocks.
I brought you back so I could beat you up!
It's just bones and shadow.
Yuck, it's barely even alive.
Looks about the same.
Is that supposed to be something?
Such a nice statue. Shame if something were to happen to it.
A big stone nerd.
It's an okay statue, I guess.
Yikes. I'd cover that up too if I were her.
She hasn't put her face on for the day yet.
A brazier would be nicer.
Make a spark, it'll still burn.
It's pokey!
A hat made of straw. To think, it could've been tinder.
It's still not a bird, but it's sure stuffed like one!
It's been picked.
It's a small, unburned plant.
We're keeping it.
It's too far out, I can't even burn it!
Not as nice as a flaming vest, but it'll do.
Sugary things burn great, but best not waste food.
I don't think it wants to be friends.
Does it like fire?
Fire makes them so much better.
Needs more fire!
Arise, my phoenix!
Is there such a thing as too much fire?
How long is this going to take?
I'm getting tired of waiting.
That egg could use some fire!
The nest is empty.
I feel like he understands.
He sure eats a lot.
Don't look at me! Get your own food.
It needs something more.
I can feel the magic!
I just want to see this world burn.
I like the way the symbols glow.
Needs to be unlocked somehow.
I'm making a monstrosity!
It feels warm.
What's this part good for?
Perhaps it could be melted into a more pleasing shape.
This is too precious to burn!
It's quite a rush to use.
Well, I've still got my badges.
I got all the badges in Girl Scouts.
Not at all cuddly.
It's pointy and slimy.
Ewwwww.
I hear little digging sounds.
It's quivering.
Awwww, they want hugs!
What a smell! Light a match next time!
I don't think it would burn.
This Thulecite crumbled to pieces.
It smells like burnt hair!
It's covered in nasty warts and fungus!!
Woah! It's packing a punch now!
It's a hole, what do you want from me?
A mutant mushroom! I want it!
What is that? It's smelly.
A top hat and a lighter, a perfect combination.
Fire is so pretty.
Walking's for suckers.
Magic stuff.
I didn't wanna walk, anyway.
Yuck. It smells like sulfur.
Crunch crunch crunch.
Electrical doo-dah, doo-dah.
It's a bit passive aggressive, but it'll work.
It would be better with fire.
I know exactly what kind of jerk leaves this lying around!
The trunk burned nicely.
It's a trunk for my junk.
Dirty trick!
Moooooooooooooove.
You'll burn like the rest!
That's how you play marbles, right? By burning them?
Hey Maxwell, I think you dropped these!
Ooh, I wonder if he has a flamethrower!
I bet Wilson would enjoy dissecting this.
She looks like she was forged in flame.
They put a bird on it.
What is it with megalomaniacs and chess?
What is it with megalomaniacs and chess?
Metal bends when it gets nice and hot.
I bet Wigfrid would be into this.
Useful only for kindling.
A cheap fake. It probably doesn't even burn properly.
This looks a little like a fire iron.
When I crank it Wes pretends to ride unicycle circles around me.
I could use this as a very long fuse...
It looks like it might melt in a fire.
I don't want Ms. Wickerbottom to be sad. Let's burn it!
I stuck one down Wolfgang's unitard when he wasn't looking. Haha.
I would have roasted it.
I want to stick it in a fire!
Chess is for pompous dorks.
Chess is for pompous dorks.
Why use a knife when you can use fire?
Probably the most boring game ever invented.
Probably the most boring game ever invented.
Just a big dumb ball.
Ewww! Who would ever wear that!
Ughhh! That's so nasty!
Hey Wes! Dare you to drink the last bit!
Pfft, they're not even sharp.
Looks like firewood to me.
He looks like he was forged in flame.
Check out those tiny thrusters. Such explosive power!
These wires get WX all frazzled. Heh heh.
Spinning the stick in the hole could start a fire. Thanks Girl Scouts!
I've never liked bathing with water.
Cute as Wendy's lil nose.
Now my friend will never leave.
Not as warm as a good fire, but still pretty good!
It still doesn't look totally edible.
Well, part of him is still cuddly.
It's so soft and squishy!
It looks highly flammable.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
My lighter doesn't work on it.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.

The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
A feast of burned bird!
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
One less tree in the world.
Burn the sick!
How are you supposed to get the sticks from up there??
Looks like campfire fuel to me!
It'll grow... unless something fiery happens to it.
Fire would release it from its torment.
A bunch of small twigs. Good for fires, among other things.
I love the color!
You can make it fancy but it's still an eel.
It's not finished. But I bet it still burns.
Hi, waffles!
It was flammable!
That looks so flammable!
Hmmm. I wonder if these will burn.
Safe for now.
I guess I could carry it.
And they'll huff and they'll puff!
Will those fit in my pockets?
Eh. I guess that's okay.
These are surprisingly heavy.
It did catch on fire!
That could totally catch on fire.
I hate hiding.
Stop following me!
I kind of like the look of it.
I'm not going in there. Yuck!
Why does everyone have a nicer house than me?
Nom nom nom.
Yes! Burn!
Aww, the fire burned out.
I want to set it on fire.
You're a big mean jerk!
A cone full of jerks.
Boo! Hissss!
I once knew a melon named Walter. He was a jerk.
Well, that's one use for this fruit.
Why would you freeze a fruit when you could burn it?
Warm, sweet, juicy Walter.
I could grow them, but that sounds boring.
Take it down a notch, %s!
Yes, %s! Burn!!!
Hi %s!
Hey %s, I'll get you a heart if you let me wear your helm!
Woahh! That's not an act! Murderer!
%s doesn't let anyone fall in battle!
It's got a name scratched on the inside... \"W\", uh...
Heh, we rubbed a bunch of paper in beeswax.
There's evil in you, huh %s?!
Amateur.
Hi %s!
Have a heart, %s! Heh heh.
%s! I knew you couldn't be trusted! Burn!!
Hahaha %s, you care about us!
Would make a great bedtime story... for nightmares!
Hey %s, you're not venomous, are you?
Your fires are so cute, %s!
Hi %s!
Don't cry, %s, I'm getting you a heart.
Monster! Burn them!
Who do ghosts call? %s!
It's not myyy way, but a burial will have to do.
I've never seen you so, uh, passionate... %s.
%s! Was that your fire? I'm so proud!
Hi %s!
Isn't death kind of your thing, %s?
She's gone nuts! Murderer!
That girl really likes ghosts!
That mime punch was really convincing! Haha, ow!
Make it BURN!
Hi %s!
%s, just tell me whatcha need and I'll get it for you. Heheheh!
Your actions speak louder than words! Murderer!
Who do ghosts call? %s!
How did it go wrong?! It was engulfed in fire and everything.
I can think of a real quick way to dry it.
There's something inside.
This means I'm the boss now.
Your bun too tight, %s?
Didn't know you had it in you, %s.
Hi %s!
Did your heart give out, %s? Just kidding! Hey!
Time for a good ol' book burnin'! Murderer!
%s is a big softie!
You're makin' us look nuts, %s!
Burny twins! High five.
Hey! That's my face, %s! Give it back!
Is that really what my ghost hair looks like?
Murderer! Burn the impostor!
Haha, nice one %s.
Why, %s... that fire in your eyes!
Oh, %s!! Let me help with your next fire!!
Hi %s!
I better get a heart for %s.
Hey %s! Your hair is dumb! Raaaugh!
%s won't leave anyone behind.
It's not warm enough for my liking.
If you'd measured fire, maybe you woulda been prepared!
It would be better if it measured fire.
Honestly, who DOESN'T eat the head first?
Doesn't look too bad, considering!
Gimme two of 'em and I can do a MacTusk impression.
Anyone else sense the overpowering stench of evil?
A log for eating, not for burning.
I'm gonna totally stuff my face!!
Sure beats rainwater!
I only like it when it's SCALDING.
Who knew stuff from a bird's butt could be so tasty?
Bibble-ty bauble-ty boo!
Woah, shiny! Nice!
It's like a fire, but without the burning!
Now we're celebrating!
Happy Winter's Feast, everybody.
Looks great!
It's a bit shrimpy.
Happy Winter's Feast, everybody.
Are we gonna grow a tree?
%s! Take it easy, big guy!
Don't hurt yourself, big guy.
Hi %s!
Hey %s, did you know the heart's a muscle?
Burn the murderer!
Woah! %s ripped a spirit straight out of the afterlife!
You're only fueling the fire, %s!
Calm down, %s. Wanna borrow Bernie?
%s! That was hilarious!
Burn it all, %s! Burn it!
Hi %s!
I better get a heart for %s.
Murderer. BURN!
Is there maple syrup in your veins, %s? You're so sweet!
Does dirt normally move around?
Light without fire. Unnatural.
It's so furry!
Poke it with a stick!
I wonder if it likes spicy food?
Yuck. That won't hold long.
Light without fire. Unnatural.
It feels like grandma's hands.
Light without fire. Unnatural.
Better cool it before you blow a gasket, %s!
Are we lighting fires?! I want in!
Hi %s!
I better get a heart for %s.
Killer robot! Burn it!
Hahaha %s, you care about us!
It seems to absorb the darkness around it.
It sparkles.
Another rock!
It's magical.
I have no idea what that is!
Hooray, it's about to light on fire!
I need more light!
Ugh. Crunchy.
Wolfgang is too woozy to do this.
Wolfgang has animal friend already!
Hair-cow is too tall. I can't reach.
Wolfgang's weekday undergarments burning? Wolfgang is sad.
Clothes only good for ripping with strong muscles!
Wolfgang will wait til they leave to change. He is shy.
Wolfgang not in cooking mood.
Oh, smells good, friend!
Is pot very small, or just far away?
Wolfgang no good at drawing pictures from head.
Wolfgang smush heart into ghost girl but nothing happen!
The Mighty Wolfgang will try again soon!
Is not working.
You know is dead, yes?
Little recipe is already in there!
Wolfgang does not think that goes there.
No!
Is needing tiny log with face.
Is needing tiny mushy-room, I think.
Not even mighty muscles can make fit!
Material is not mighty enough for strong statues!
I do not think little platform would like that.
Is sleeping now!
Something is already put!
Little rock does not want to go there.
Bones is wrong shape.
Please give Mighty Wolfgang your attention!
You know is dead, yes?
Make room for Wolfgang's presents!
Friend is sleeping now!
Please give Mighty Wolfgang your attention!
You know is dead, yes?
Make room for Wolfgang's presents!
Friend is sleeping now!
Hair-cow is occupied by another.
I cannot ride it now! Hair-cow is proving itself in battle!
Is wrong piece for little statue!
Maybe Wolfgang do later.
Wolfgang would like to use after you, if okay.
I cannot ride it now! Hair-cow is proving itself in battle!
I will wait until he is not looking.
That cannot be shaved.
I cannot shave when there are no hairs.
I will make it fit!
Wolfgang can share!
Bah! Useless.
I do not get it.
Wolfgang already knows this!
Little paper is not for here!

Hmm, maybe Wolfgang try shotput?
Pretty gem sits in stick.
What is this thing?
Is almost fire.
Help friends! Save Wolfgang from dark!
This egg too crunchy.
I feel worse than a used roll of duct tape. Maybe later?
I need to take care of the pet I have.
Not as tall as a moose, but still too high to place that.
Better it than a tree.
Ouch. Do I not look skookum enough already?
Could you hand me my plaid shirt while you're in there?
That's not really in my wheelhouse, sorry.
Careful now, don't burn it.
I gotta get closer, eh?
I won't get it right unless I have the item in front of me.
I'd never hear the end of it from 'Luce if I didn't try.
I'll try again in a mo'.
Didn't work. Probably for the best.
I don't think they... um...
No sense having two of the same recipe.
Nah, that ain't right.
Not today.
That needs a magic log, eh?
That needs a mushroom spore, eh?
That doesn't look like a magic rock to me.
I'd prefer wood, personally.
Nah. Something long and thin goes there, but not this.
It's sleeping.
I should probably use what's up there first.
I don't think that one'll work here.
That's gotta be rebuilt, eh?
I've something for you when you've got a mo'.
I don't think they... um...
They need to make room for my present, eh?
Let them get some shut eye.
I've something for you when you've got a mo'.
I don't think they... um...
They need to make room for my present, eh?
Let them get some shut eye.
Maybe I can find a caribou to ride instead.
I should wait for the dust to settle, eh?
That piece ain't right.
I can't right now. Sorry!
Sorry! I'll wait til you're finished there.
I should wait for the dust to settle, eh?
I don't think she'd like that.
You can't shave what's not hair.
It's already shorn, eh?
I like my beard.
It's already packed tighter than a Toronto streetcar.
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to hover over your shoulder.
I could probably find a better place to put that.
Err... do you understand this one, 'Luce?
I know that already, eh?
I don't think I'm in the right place for this.
Now's not the time, eh?
That was the wrong key, eh?
I need some things to wrap first, eh?
No thanks. I have terrible writing.
If I could just... scooch in there after you...
Sorry, I can't do that.
Lucy is going to be so proud of me!
That's a wrap, eh!
Oh well. I gave it a good try.
Pothole incoming.
Take cover!
Dangerous 'round here.
Maybe put the sinkholes on pause, eh?
I got a tribute for you, eh?
This here's for you, eh?
We better hightail it out of here.
Let's skedaddle!
There'll be trouble if we don't leave.
oOooOOOO!!
Bees! Bees!
Sorry! Clumsy me!
Ouch, that's hot!
\nI think I can fix this!
Sounds like some trouble up above.
Who's there, eh?
Yeouch! That was rough!
It's a bit chilly out here!
I'll always have the North in my heart.
I can't do that right now.
A bit damp, eh?
What was that?
Fixed'r right up.
It's almost my bedtime.
Tasty!
I don't think my teeth could cut through that.
That was past the expiry date.
That was a wee bit manky.
I got to that one just in time.
I'd rather chew on blubber balls.
Hnff...
Huff... huff...
No... Don't get up... Lucy...
Heavy... Eh...?
...oof...
I'll keep... lumberin' along...
No point... complainin'...
Work's... gotta get done...
Nothin' like... honest work...
I'm more of a chopper than a lifter...
Who turned out the lights?
Brilliance!
I guess I'll just have to suffer now.
I got out!
I'm goin', like, nutso over here...
Informative.
It's so hot out here!
There's something out there.
I'm getting peckish.
The beastie is nearby.
I'm more of a woodsman than a hunter anyway.
The beastie's tracks washed away.
Need more poop, eh?
I can't carry any more kit.
Monster hosers, incoming.
I think it's time to run.
You shoulda stayed down.
Ow. What was that?
That tickled a bit, eh?
That was barely even worth it, eh?
Skeeters!
This beast looks in a bad way, eh.
I better deal with these hosers first.
Now's definitely the wrong time to be celebratin' Christmas.
Can't siesta, something's chasing me.
It's too scary out to sleep.
Only a hoser sleeps during the day.
I'm not feelin' too restful right now.
My belly is rumbling. I'd never be able to relax.
My belly is too empty to fall asleep.
I'd rather open that with my feet on the ground.
I prefer to siesta between chopping sessions, not at night.
I prefer to siesta between chopping sessions, not at night.
Not sure that's entirely safe.
That's okay. I just need a good flannel, anyway.
Close one!
Sorry! I'll try harder!
No! Not the wood!
Well that's not right.
The ground is heaving!
That's just impolite, eh.
Learnin' keeps your mind sharp. Like an axe.
All that hard work gone to waste.
We didn't cut it, Lucy.
Thanks'm.
Thanks for the shelter, buddy. I'm still gonna chop you.
You'll have to do better than that.
Better hold on tight, Lucy.
Ouch!
No more luring, I guess.
The warty hoser ran away!
It's gonna turn tail soon.
The stuff of nightmares!
My light ran out!
I got sand in my beard.
Oops!
Ouch! That wasn't very polite.
Plaid's warm, even when wet.
I'm getting quite wet, eh?
It was gross in there!
Oh geez. I hope you're ready, Lucy.
Hunting season's open!
Get over here, eh!
I'll make bacon of you yet!
This here's the end for you!
For the North!
Prepare for a choppin'!
I think that's enough.
I thought that would go better.
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry!
Same time again tomorrow, eh?
That ain't right.
It's a flower? I guess.
Maybe we should split, eh?
I'm not comfortable with this.
Yup. It's a flower.
That flower's acting funny...
Did it just move?
It seems a bit show-offy to me.
I should grow it and then chop it down!
What a waste of a perfectly good tree.
Here comes a tree!
I wonder if that's the way out of here.
Always have a backup plan.
Looks a little worn out.
There's axe marks on these altar stones.
Looks a little worn out.
Another hoser.
A large woodland creature passed this way!
They grow'em big out here, eh?
That critter's in a real bad mood.
It seems agreeable.
Could give it to some sandy hoser.
Plaid is all the armour I need.
It's better than nothing.
It's hard to swing an axe while wearing this.
That'll stop the hurt.
Sticks to yer ribs.
It tickles. I think it's still alive.
You can never be too safe.
It fits me so well!
It makes me queasy to look at.
Wood is the best at burning.
Let the wood guide the way.
Let's give our neighbours some guidance.
Wood is the best at burning.
Let the wood guide the way.
Let's give our neighbours some guidance.
It's all burnt up.
This used to be an eyebone.
This used to be a slimy flower.
Well that's a shame.
It's soaking up energy, hey?
Don't wanna overdo it.
That'd be my cue to leave.
Where d'you think it goes, Lucy?
That oughta do it.
Got it from that big bony hoser.
Gotta be a way to turn it on.
What a nightmare.
It probably said something important. Oh well.
It's an old drawing of strange creatures.
Nothin' of interest left here.
Black muck is covering everything in this drawing.
Don't look at this one, Lucy.
Looks like a bustling city.
Was it supposed to be holding something?
It's not as nice as Lucy.
A face only a mother could love.
I enjoy sleeping outside, too.
That's a decent looking rucksack.
Awww. It's just front bacon.
It's squeaky. Just like a real woodland creature.
Are those balloons?
At least I didn't have to pay for it.
That rock ain't going to move.
Who taught that rat to fly?
A mouse with wings?
Full of the little critters!
Gross!
Gross! And tasty! So confusing!
My hair's not that colour. Not my beard, anyway.
That's a big bear!
Now this is some proper winter gear.
It's as thick as my head!
I love camping.
I slept on worse back at the lumber camp.
She's making the flowers grow.
Now what do I do with her?
No, not the bees!
Maple syrup substitute!
Buzzers!
I'm getting hungry just looking at it.
Maple syrup substitute!
I could get more if I waited.
I like this one's attitude.
I think he likes me.
He smells like a sod house.
Cheer up, eh?
Why so glum, chum?
You're almost as big as a moose!
I'm sorry, want to go for a ride?
He's catching some zeds.
Now I'm the king of the beefalo!
It feels like my beard.
Hopefully no one's allergic, eh?
That'll keep the bees out of yer eyes.
They're all comfy-cozy in there.
I don't know if the bees like this.
Hey! That's just mean!
Bees got no business getting that big.
I'm not eating honey off the ground.
The bees are planning something.
Nature is something else, eh?
Yeesh, that's waxy.
I'm amazed it makes such a crisp sound.
I guess I should be used to weird stuff by now.
Poor lil guy.
Cute, isn't it 'Luce?
I have a heartier appetite than that.
Tastes like warm berries.
That's good eatin', eh?
Mmm. These'd be perfect with some syrup.
It needs a good poopin'.
Can't save it now.
It's caught a bit of a bug.
Lookin' a bit down.
Saskatoon berries?
No berries left!
It's perished from the heat, eh?
Lookin' pretty barren.
Can't save it now.
It's caught a bit of a bug.
Lookin' a bit down.
I see a snack.
Eh, they'll be back.
Dry as the Alberta plains.
Watch where you're stepping!
I'll chop you too!
I'm sorry. I failed you.
Where I try to make birds reform their evil ways.
I'll get you something to eat soon, buddy.
Think aboot what you've done, bird!
That's starting to smell.
They look so innocent when they dream.
He's got a hankering for some poutine!
I'll show those birds yet!
There's a bird in there, thinking evil bird thoughts.
Well, at least it never became a bird.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Hey now!
I can see the internal workings!
This seems a bit aggressive.
Anyone want a demonstration of my impressive lungpower?
A couple blows on that and you can escape just aboot anything!
Gross bird parts made an okay weapon, I guess.
Just need a tasty beverage to cool now, eh?
It's very cold.
It sees all with the cold sight of the North.
I'm not one for book learning.
Looks real complicated, that one.
That's not meat.
That's not meat.
I can never remember which ones you can eat.
I'll come back later.
Well, that's over.
So smooth. You can really see the grain.
Must have hit a Nor'easter.
I wish I knew how to make bread.
Sticks to your ribs.
I already know more than enough aboot those things.
I know better than to mess with that, eh.
Does it grow trees?
The perfect book for a full moon.
They don't have tentacles in Canada.
That looks hard to throw.
You could debark a log with this thing.
It can collect skeeters.
What's inside? Hope it's logs.
The paper's brown. Like wood.
He looks friendly enough.
Done for.
It's good for hiding from nature.
I prefer margarine.
I never trusted those things, eh?
Where are you going to run?
Crunchy! ...But soft?
Sorry! Sorry. How awful!
Stay away from those meat snacks!
That's gonna hurt.
Called it.
It's a wonder anything grows in this climate at all.
Would you put nails in your mouth?
Much better.
It's almost gone.
Where's my guitar?
Uh oh! It's bit high!
I should probably do something aboot that, eh?
I love a fire in the evening.
It was good while it lasted.
Degenerate.
Want a peek at our prisoner, Lucy?
Diseased vermin.
That there bag could hold a whole heap of candy.
It's good for the back country.
That's rabbit food.
That's cooked rabbit food.
I'm not one for vegetables, eh?
Tiny carrots.
Looks like the map ends here.
Eh, I prefer to just wander around the woods anyway.
Heh. Has a little compass and everything.
Pests.
Good riddance.
Ugh, how many more lives do you have?
The traditional garb of the woodsman.
Some elbow grease'll move those, easy.
Can't reach that one.
It tastes tropical.
Such a waste.
Now it's a warm mush.
They don't have those back home.
It's all bunged up.
More crowded than a Toronto subway!
There're probably no trees down there anyway.
It looks like Sudbury down there.
It's all bunged up.
Sorry! I'll wait til you're all done up there!
Maybe later. I've gotten cozy down here.
There are probably trees up there.
Hey! It's a fern!
This makes me a bit sad.
Dead metal.
Dead metal.
Dead metal.
Good use of stone.
That's not really my sort of thing, eh?
Get ready, Lucy.
Fine detail on that base.
Good stonework.
Looks like a bit of a hoser.
Well, I did say I had a hankering for \"stone fruit\".
I miss horses.
Get ready, Lucy.
Looks sturdy.
I don't tend to trust anyone without a face. Lucy excluded, of course.
Just a humble peasant, really.
Kitschy. Just how Lucy and I like it.
Pfft, tacky.
Get ready, Lucy.
He's doing his best!
No one ever told him it was rude to stare.
I wonder if it will ever wake up again.
It's almost gone.
This'll make it feel more like home.
Uh oh! It's bit high!
I should probably do something aboot that, eh?
I love a cold fire in the evening.
It was good while it lasted.
I should go chop some wood for that, eh?
It uses wood.
That's too much wood too fast!
There should be some wood around here somewhere.
Mmmm. Smells woody.
If only I had some wood.
East.
Points to the True North.
True North.
Northeast.
Northwest.
South.
Southeast.
Southwest.
West.
Was that a bad thing to do?
Just like my dear old ma used to make.
I still don't want to eat it.
That'll just make me hungrier!
Burned to a crisp.
It'll be a bit longer, eh?
Oh boy! Here it comes!
Time for supper!
It seems a waste to just leave it sitting there, empty.
That's the end of that cat's tale.
I like it, but not in everything that I eat.
Cooked with the goodness of corn.
I'm more of a hewer of wood than a tiller of soil.
Anyone home?
Don't start no forest fires now, buddy.
Charmingly chubby.
Giving it pats is relaxing.
Heh, it feels like a beard.
Look, it's not you. It's me.
Man and robot's best friend.
He's planning something. I can tell.
You'll pay for your crimes, crow!
I think I might be allergic to this.
Yum! Tastes woody!
Want to hear my loon call?
Part of the Canadian shield.
That doesn't smell quite right, eh.
Nooo! I could have chopped it!
What a waste.
Ahhhh!
It's calling to me!
You're due for a chopping.
Something's different aboot you...
That's a creature of the woods, eh?
That's a big moose!
Now what is this good for?
Wish I still had a cabin I could mount these things in.
That ain't natural.
It's probably a tuft of grass.
That's easy on the eyes.
I'm not commenting on that.
Hey! A clue!
It's really fuzzy from here.
I wonder if it gets the hockey game.
Loud and clear! Something's near!
I think I'm getting closer.
Woah, careful there, bud.
It looks like something should plug in.
It's ready to be unlocked.
Now all it needs is to be turned on.
That's a weird looking rod.
Nice needlework.
She'll burn all the trees before I can chop them!
Gaudy if you ask me.
Tacky taxidermy.
It got even tackier, eh?
I'm sweaty enough without help from a furnace.
Just bask in that warm glow.
I've never seen one of those before.
It tastes like maple syrup.
Maybe I can grow more.
That's a sight, eh?
Almost as good as butter tarts!
Well, somebody's gotta do it.
I still don't believe in dragons.
October food.
Thanks, turkey.
Time for a little landscaping.
This would be more useful somewhere else, eh?
It makes my eyes water.
I should plant this.
Mmmmm. It's all twiggy.
It smells bad.
It smells even worse.
Why would I want to grow more of those things?
Where I'm from these'd only work in the fall.
This should cook up nicely.
This cooked up nicely.
I bet the birds have something to do with this.
Suspiciously birdy.
Hmmm. I'm not sure.
A burnt wood table.
Such a beaut of a wood table shouldn't be hidden by a cloth.
About time we brightened this place up, eh?
A little bit of nature makes everything nicer.
We need bulbs, eh.
Well, that's that.
Nooo! I could have chopped it!
What a waste.
Ahhhh!
It's calling to me!
Sorry!
How terrible!
Another one!
Lucy would want me to chop it down.
Always good to have something watching over you.
It needs to mind its own business.
That'll drive the hosers off.
This needs to be installed properly.
If it was a tree farm, I'd be sad.
I prefer larger plants.
They'll never reach chopping size.
I think it needs some poop.
A traditional Canadian fan.
I want nothing to do with that... thing.
The bird murder wasn't even necessary. Heh.
A grody feather.
A gross feather.
A disgusting feather.
A stupid feather.
She's trapped!
That's a good lookin' fence.
Some nice woodwork there.
A good project for a lazy afternoon.
A good project for a lazy afternoon.
Poop belongs in a bucket, not on the ground.
Let's not set them off in the forest.
Reminds me of Algonquin park.
I've got a pocket full of sunshine!
Hot hound!
I should go chop some wood for that, eh?
It uses wood.
Too much wood, too fast!
There should be some wood around here somewhere.
Mmmm. Smells woody.
If only I had some wood.
I don't trust any sort of magic business.
It craves wood.
Lazy thing.
Save the trees!
Looks like a cod.
I should spend some time at the lake.
Elegant dining in a box.
Tastes like the sea, eh?
Could use some chips.
This could be an axe head.
That's nice.
Not very satisfying chopping, that.
I think wildflowers look nice with my red hair.
Healthy, but not very hardy.
Shiny!
Something is wrong with that flower.
Someone's got a brown thumb.
Looks like a salad.
Will this give me hockey hair?
Brittle.
One hundred percent assembled beastie.
Eh... Should we try again, Lucy?
Still got some work to do, looks like.
Ex-frog.
I don't trust anything that can't decide between air and water.
It's tired.
You can really taste the swamp.
They're still jumping!
At least they stopped moving.
In syrup!
Shh! The creature might still be around.
That's unfortunate there, buddy.
Hmph. Maybe I don't got it so bad.
I never could figure these things out.
It'll need a gem.
Looks ready.
Boo! Ha ha!
They're just as fun to give as they are to receive.
Should we do something nice today, Lucy?
Well it ain't wood.
I wonder if it chops.
Keep flapping, little guy!
Dead and still slimy.
Even the flower is slimy.
Yep, his slime is slimy too.
Unsurprisingly, the wings are slimy.
I think the electricity curdled it.
Seems pretty useless.
It's almost as nice as Lucy.
It's pretty, but it can't chop down trees.
Welp. I can't unmake it, so...
Time to dig golden holes.
You can't make a coffee table out of gold.\nWell, maybe you can. But you shouldn't.
Pillowy plumage.
I need to poop on it.
I hope that doesn't spread to the trees.
It's caught a bit of a bug.
Lookin' a bit down.
Looks like kindling.
It's gone all nubbly.
Maybe it'd thrive if it was cooler out?
It's lookin' pretty unhealthy.
Where's the log lizard?
That there could keep my beard moderately dry, eh?
I get a bit of a weird feeling around these things.
How flashy.
That should help everyone get the lay of the land.
This'll help me dismantle stuff!
I've eaten stranger things in the woods.
I don't trust it.
It's a green mushroom.
They have their own schedule.
I'll have to be patient.
I'm not sure I trust it.
It stinks less than the other kind.
Never did like this stuff.
Even the stick is delicious.
I'll tell you what it tastes like, Lucy.
Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
Don't worry, I'll eat enough for the both of us, Lucy.
Just a regular ol' cob of corn.
Yeesh. That's a lot of candy legs.
These ones don't puke. I like 'em.
Not sure that's food, eh?
Eh. I don't mind 'em.
I'll tell you what it tastes like, Lucy.
Not too bad, eh?
What a waste of good ham.
Everyone makes mistakes, eh?
I really prefer plaid.
Healthiness in goo form.
It's gone cold, eh?
Brrr! It's frozen.
We call those \"night rocks\" back home.
I could chop all winter with that in my pocket!
It's getting a bit... tepid.
Hmph. Real regal.
Who's there?
Wood is the best at burning.
Is there anything wood can't do?
Let's give our neighbours some guidance.
Mmmmmm-mmmm. Bee syrup.
The poor bees probably worked their stingers off on this.
But it's not a holiday...
That's one of my favourite meals!
I don't know if anyone should put their mouth on that.
Good after a long day of chopping in the cold.
They'd be good at pulling a sled.
It's covered with dog spit, eh?
I know better than to mess with that.
It's a beaut.
Friendly lil guy, eh?
I've never had one of these before.
It was bound to happen.
A tiny reminder of home.
Ahhhh. Reminds me of home.
Only after I've chopped enough!
I could chop it if I had to.
Arctic hounds?
Good for long hikes.
It reminds me of home.
Where did it go?!
I don't know how to move that.
Beard's growing out nicely.
Now to find peanut butter.
You can barely taste the bean!
The stick really adds to the flavour.
That bee doesn't seem as friendly.
She's none too pleased with her situation.
Thing's got no eyes, eh?
Gotta be some use for that.
Something good's in there, eh?
Never did care for horses.
Doesn't look to be in the best of shape.
He looks tasty.
They get tastier in the winter.
Back off, hoser!
Seems wrong to take someone else's sack.
Well that's enlightening, eh?
Death by axe!
Lil buddy cooled right off.
There's a fire burning in there.
She could use a parka.
Cozier than a moose wrapped in duct tape!
Look how happy she is!
That's my lil critter.
Poor gal's getting hungry.
Skinnier than a blue heron's legs.
Not as sharp as Lucy!
My trees are safe now.
Aaaah! Tree killer!
I wouldn't get too close to that, eh?
Boulder-dash.
I'm sorry aboot all of those trees!
I'm sorry aboot all of those trees!
Looks barely edible.
This should cure those sniffles.
It looks chewy.
Keep it away from the trees!
Nice goat, nice goat!
That's a nice pair of horns you've got there.
I'm sure the goat didn't need it.
It's pretty as the Northern lights.
Weather's not going to get the drop on me now.
Why are they so far south?
I want to keep you, and call you \"Frank\".
I feel conflicted, eh?
Oh no! Don't put another log on the fire!
It makes it all worthwhile.
I could use a bit of luck.
I love Lucy!
Shucks, I'm gonna have to chop it again.
Is that meat?
It's warm and lumpy.
Do you need help?
Sorry, little buddy.
It's a tiring soup.
This is the worst thing.
Sorry!
It's looking at me.
I feel sorry for it.
Is it still a map if nothing's on it?
Feels like a government building.
The magical fruit.
Well lookit that. It sprouted.
Somebody must have built that.
Defo can't chop that.
Even Lucy can't chop that one down.
Foomph!
That's a bramble.
Was that worth it?
Plant.
That's what you get for being spiky!
It deserved it.
It was a hard battle, but I won.
Trees shouldn't fight back!
Why does he hate me?
Just a head, eh?
That's unnatural.
Where is the key?
Better than most of the stuff on the radio.
I've seen nicer chairs.
Tastes like moose.
All the meats!
Its usefulness has dried up.
That looks done.
This is like watching meat dry.
This is like watching meat dry... in the rain.
It's all set up. Just add meat.
It tastes like survival.
What foul sea did that crawl out of?
Amazingly, it smells even worse now.
Smells like a factory trawler.
Couldn't even build a fireproof house.
They're not the handiest.
Down deep in a coal mine.
I'm not used to the heat in this place!
Is there anything wood can't do?
What is this... some sort of sign?
Good, sturdy wood.
Another poor soul with a curse.
That's a nice chest with horns, eh.
That's a nice horn, eh.
It feels aboot rocks the way I feel aboot trees.
Want some rocks?
Dig, dig, dig.
Now featuring night-time chopping!
I bet it's just a pile of rocks inside.
Well then. That's a new one.
What a fine choice of building material.
This is cat food!
I'm not hungry enough for that.
I still don't want to eat it.
That'll need more than a roll of duct tape to fix.
I'd rather not muck with that if I can help it.
That oughta keep us cool.
I'm happy to just leave it there for now.
Looks a little off.
We're free from the moon's reach down here.
Do I really need to be reminded of the moon during the day?
Not a good night to have a curse, but then when's it ever?
The moon's gone for now. Phew.
The moon's waning. Time for some peace and quiet.
The moon's waxing again.
Just about time again, Lucy.
I think it's missing something.
It's uh, a moon rock.
That's in a pretty sorry state, eh?
Whatever it is, it's definitely Canadian.
Well, it lays eggs, apparently.
Where's the pyromaniac? This needs to burn.
That'll take a pint out of me!
What do I do with this, eh?
Blood and guts, eh?
Feathery moose baby!
Don't be mad!
I should probably leave that alone.
That'd be the thing I fell through, eh.
It's... it's beautiful.
I don't like the look of that.
That there'll make you one with the forest.
Don't breathe it in, Lucy!
Mushrooms don't have no reason to be that big.
If a log burns in the forest does it hurt my feelings? Yes. It does.
It needs a bit of help getting started.
It's doing real well on its own.
That rotten log needs replacing.
Everybody's got hardships, eh?
There we go. Everyone needs a bit of help sometimes.
Doesn't need us no more.
Whose bright idea was it to kill the lights?
My kind of decor.
Soak in that all-natural light, Lucy.
That got charred real good.
It oughta be green like a lush, choppable forest.
It illuminates with all the colours of the wind.
I like the colour of this one.
Maybe I should chop it.
Well, I can't cut it down now...
It's made of wood.
Chop it down before it spreads!
I can't let that stand.
This one needs pruning, at least.
What kind of darkness is that?
All of my fears in liquid form, eh?
They should have used wood.
I think it's off.
It's nearly still.
I think it's off.
It's going crazy!
It's settling down.
This thing just turned on!
It's vibrating!
That's mighty nifty.
Nightmares can't hurt ya!
It's how we built the railway.
That's a whole lotta wet.
I stand on guard for thee!
You're fond of it, aren'tcha Lucy?
Err, moon magic isn't really... my thing... Heh.
This'll make the chores go by quicker!
It's shimmering.
Makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
This will help me get around quickly.
What's in the box?!
I only sing for Lucy.
I'd rather chop than write.
Doesn't matter if you're from the Great White North. Still a bird.
More birds! Why is it always birds?
It had to be birds, didn't it?
It's all burnt up.
Could use a touch of green.
I'm not giving anything to those birds!
I call them \"yum pockets\".
I wonder if Lucy would like these.
They're frowning at me with little evil faces.
So... senseless.
I wouldn't want that in my moustache.
Almost an axe, but not quite.
I don't want to make him mad.
Used all the parts of the pig.
I'd like to complain to the chef. Politely.
What a waste of good pork.
A mere shell of its former glory.
It's bacon-stuffed.
A little duct tape would fix that right up.
Sorry! I'm not peeping, I swear!
He's not MY king.
Not a pig anymore.
We're a team! Yah!
Walking back bacon!
That one looks like he means business.
Happens to the best of us.
Bacon with a tail.
Looks to be some sort of tent.
How did they do that without thumbs?
I should grow it and then chop it down!
Here comes a tree!
That really isn't my style.
That's gross!
Cooking it didn't help much.
I wonder what it will be.
A watched plant never grows.
Time for grub.
It's got no life left, eh?
%s isn't very polite...
Knock off the fire starting there, bud.
Look who it is! %s!
Someone should rub a heart on %s.
Enemy of the forest!
%s, you're an alright sort.
That's too fancy for me.
This would go good on flapjacks.
Seedy.
I can't swim!
Doesn't look edible.
Don't poop in camp!
I do love me some plant life.
I like the ones made with real sugar better.
I don't like to eat things that grow on the ground.
This will keep me chopping.
Pies are good.
It'd better not tip over.
It's a seed.
The sparkle is gone from the gem.
It's nothing a good chopping wouldn't fix.
A pretty useful guide in this neck of the woods.
Dang ground squirrels...
I'd feel bad eating him.
I doubt there are trees down there.
Nothing going in or out.
Is it roasted carrot flavoured?
Is it carrot flavoured?
For chopping in the rain.
Always keep a dry head while chopping.
Its knowledge of rain didn't keep it from being burned.
Rain makes the trees grow.
It's like a forest in a bowl.
A true lumberjack never shaves.
I see within it the fiery death of a thousand trees.
This little light of mine.
A true woodsman knows his own way around the forest.
It's Lucy-colour.
I don't know...
You'd have to be really, really hungry.
It's a red mushroom.
They have their own schedule.
I'll have to be patient.
Fire makes me nervous.
Reeds.
They'll be back.
I'm still not convinced plaid isn't all-weather wear.
I don't plan on fixin' that.
How did it get burned?!
I don't trust all this science stuff.
Well, it obeys some basic laws of physics.
This is getting strange.
Nope, lost it.
Okay, I kind of get it now.
This is why I don't use hat warmers.
I like to call it the \"Hat Machine\"!
That's a shame, that.
All my buddies could be improved with wood.
I don't know if I should touch that.
I need to share this with somebody!
What a snotty little jerk.
Don't get comfortable, birdie.
Go fly south or something!
It's stealing my warmth.
They're trapped!
I could break it down if I tried hard enough.
Could make a decent little inukshuk with these.
Lobster supper time!
Home sweet home!
Back home, they never melt.
Back home, they never melt.
It's looking a tad crusty.
Needs more... wood?
A fire that needs no wood? Unnn-natural!
It looks like it could break.
It's uh, a moon rock.
So... senseless.
So... senseless.
Hmm... does the rook move in a straight line? I forget.
The gears are spilling out.
Good for holding stuff to other stuff.
One less bird. Good.
I'm majestic enough as is.
Broken furniture.
It's no toque, but it'll do.
Metal on a stick.
All busted up.
It makes my beard hair stand on end.
It's thinkin' real hard.
Puts the critter back to how nature intended.
Yep, that'll get us there.
Makes me feel like some sorta woodland nymph, eh?
Makes me feel like a Mountie.
My mouth's dry just looking at it.
Some good craftsmanship.
That's something else, eh?
Something is off aboot that rock, eh?
That makes sense.
Aw! He barely had a chance!
It's caught a bit of a bug.
A poor excuse for wood.
I want to see it grow so I can chop it down.
Picking isn't as fun as chopping.
With this heat it'll never grow to chopping size!
Glad that's not me.
Great, now those feathered hosers are gonna run wild.
He's doing the world a service.
Yikes.
I'm really more of a whittler.
Back to whittling.
Oughta put a block of cut stone up there.
Hm. Not bad, eh?
I don't get art. Whattaya think Lucy?
Whose bright idea was it to fix this thing?
Is stone supposed to move like that?
Creepy.
That doesn't seem right.
Once you've seen one weird statue, you've seen'em all.
Just needed a little duct tape.
Is stone supposed to move like that?
Yikes. Put it back in.
That's a heavy lookin' hoser.
Just a big hunk of stone, as far as I'm concerned.
As if I didn't have enough reasons to hate full moons.
Is stone supposed to move like that?
Looks a bit like one of them chargin' hosers.
Just a big hunk of marble, that.
Not trees.
We call this \"lumberjack surprise\".
That's an odd looking tree.
I'm pretty good at sewing.
Makes me feel right at home.
Are your little buddies, uh... alive?
Yeesh. Don't get that near me.
Dig a hole. Plant a tree!
That's gross.
It's a husk.
Naps are important during a long day of chopping.
Spiders give me the willies.
Sorry, friend.
That right there's a cursed object, eh?
Poor %s. I should watch out for %s, eh?
Poor %s. %s got her, eh?
Poor %s. %s got him, eh?
Poor %s. %s got them, eh?
Some plans for a fancy stone carving.
That's scary!
Some folks around here could use the shuteye.
I think it's living hair.
Where's the nearest fur trader?
Looks like a dead beaver.
He's just misunderstood.
That could sure keep a noggin safe.
Are you guys doing okay in there?
Someone needs a tissue.
His home is broken now. Oh.
What do you want?
It wants something.
I think it's starving.
I wish this were bigger.
Just a bite.
Spirals!
Reminds me of momma!
It lacks the heft of a good solid axe.
Who needs a spear when you got ol'Luce?
Good!
That's the biggest spider I've ever seen!
Careful, now, eh?
Holy Mackinaw! Look at that thing!
Why would I want to carry that around?
I think it's poison.
She's a real beaut, ain't she?
I should skedaddle before they come out of there.
I should skedaddle before they come out of there.
You're not MY queen!
They're smart to live away from the corruption.
Tricky devil!
Spitting is rude!
Great!
They come in yellow now?
You're snoozin' fer a bruisin'.
Aw, it's Diefenbakered.
A floating red pinecone!
One day this might be a tree.
We've been visited by a forest sprite, Lucy!
One day this might be a tree.
A flying green pinecone!
One day this might be a tree.
At least it won't start a forest fire.
Well ain't that something.
I prefer to chop the trees myself.
I really wish I hadn't seen that.
Not my style.
I'm not too interested in rocks.
I'm not too interested in rocks.
It's a walking anatomy lesson.
That fuel stuff's gone to its head.
Ain't no reason for that to exist.
It had some cool things inside, eh?
That's a curious statue, eh?
You lost your head, eh?
I'm gonna make fun of him for this later, eh?
She's a real tall one, eh?
I'm not sure I get it.
Could make a nice planter outta that.
That'll put the shine back on yer axe.
Ouch! It's pointy.
It'll keep the sun off yer head.
I'm getting better at cooking.
There's a lot of water in there for such a tiny plant.
That's a plant, eh?
Ain't a tree, but ain't bad.
That wood has seen better days.
It's not plaid, but it'll do.
Sugary good.
I don't trust birds that can't fly, either.
What's in here?
It tastes like justice.
Too cold for you?
It's hatching.
Is it crying?
Birds are never prompt.
Anytime now.
I should steal its egg to teach it a lesson.
Nothing there.
It's growing up to be a jerk, just like its parents.
Are you ALWAYS hungry?
It getting wild with hunger.
Needs gems, eh?
It's ready, but am I?
Ready to go, eh?
It's a... magic thing, I think.
There are bits missing, eh?
It's almost ready, eh?
Box-y, eh?
Crank-y, eh?
Potato-y, eh?
Ring-y, eh?
I wonder what this thing does.
I don't think it can still be considered a tent.
I'm used to sleeping in worse.
There a squid down there?
It wobbles when you wave it.
I'm blushing!
I'm tired of these squids!
It's so big!
Are those squid babies?
Not even a stump left behind!
It's the wood of the caves!
It's not wood but it'll do.
Someone's trying to give us a leg up.
I'm gonna need a bigger axe.
Alright, enough playin' around! Get'em Lucy!
It's a hole.
It isn't polypore-sonal, I just gotta chop you.
Is that how trees are born?
It's too fancy.
Trees by torchlight.
Get a move on.
Some sort of sandy transportation.
Time to get a move on.
S'got a powerful stink, eh?
The perfect snack for a day of chopping.
I won't even pretend to know how that works.
Work smarter, eh?
This seems a bit rough.
That's not playing fair, eh?
I guess wood does have a downside...
Wood is so handy! Look at all the things you can make!
Something is not quite right aboot that chest.
You're asking for a good chop, bud.
The forest spirits have been angered!
I used to play that game.
Choppers for old folks.
Quiet, you!
It's all withered.
She looks friendly.
Gaudy as all get-out.
And here I am just a pawn, eh?
And here I am just a pawn, eh?
It needs to be straightened, eh?
I would have liked this when I was a boy.
It keeps falling over, eh?
Much kazoo about nothing.
Wigfrid keeps using it to \"spar\" with me and Lucy. We're afraid.
It belongs in a kitchen, not in the woods.
I'd rather have some proper rope.
Maxwell probably needs that for his fancy shoes.
We should whip up some pumpkin cookies to put in it, eh?
I already smell like pine and woodchips, according to Lucy.
Genius! A cup for a proper woodsman.
No point hanging clothes in the woods.
That one moves diagonally, I think.
That's, uh, the rook piece.
Reminds me of a story I heard once.
That one can only move one square at time.
That's the, uh, horse piece.
I'd rather my future be a surprise.
Creepy.
That right there's a bad time waitin' to happen.
Doesn't even have a label.
More intimidating than beaver teeth.
What a waste of wood, eh?
Wolfgang would appreciate that moustache.
It needs a robot arm, eh?
They're not good any more, eh?
Might take it to the kid.
Reminds me... gotta convince Willow to take a *real* bath.
I just sew my clothing shut around me when I put it on.
Nice and breezy.
This could stand up to the winters back home, eh?
I think it boiled off all of the nose cheese.
It's pretty thin.
It's thick and hairy.
I wish it was sturdier so I could chop it.
Just some ground, eh?
Too classy for my tastes.
Some ground.
Looks like one of those city-people outhouses.
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Fire doesn't quite take here, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
It's mushy, like peas.
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
At least you don't have to clean it.
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
I found this underground.
Rocks. Bleh.
Flooring fit for a king!
Turkey day is here again!
Sorry!
How terrible!
Another one!
It's caught a bit of a bug.
Choppin's choppin'.
With a little care, this could make fer some good choppin'.
One day it'll make good chopping.
I'd be lucky to get two chops out of that thing.
I should build a tiny axe to chop these.
Something like that'd keep my beard dry, eh?
It'll fill ya up.
It doesn't look safe.
I prefer flapjacks.
Well that escalated quickly.
You could sneeze it down.
I could sneeze it apart.
Looks nice'n'sturdy.
It's not much use like that.
Crumbling, but still secure, eh?
Heh, stoned again, eh?
Safe and secure, eh?
Safe and secure, eh?
I miss the old you.
I like the look of that!
I like the look of that!
Oh no. Walruses again!
My granddad wore a hat like that.
This won't be safe come winter.
Walruses are nearby, eh?
He had a cavity, eh?
Wood is the best at burning.
Not so useful now, eh?
It's hard to stay neat and tidy in the woods.
That thing could pull a sled by its lonesome.
Why are those bees so angry?
Could be fun times lobbin' these around.
How can it be both water and melon?
Well, points for creativity.
Wood AND food?!
I'm not sure aboot grilled fruit...
Maybe I could plant them?
%s has raiding and looting on the brain...
What's with the fires lately, bud?
%s! Hey bud!
With a heart you'll be feelin' like your mighty self in no time.
Your spear versus my axe, let's see whatcha got, eh!
I'm glad you're on our side, %s.
Pretty snappy looking.
A good place to spit out your gum.
%s'll end up on the wrong end of my axe if he's not careful...
You'll not want to be burning things, bud.
Hey %s, how you doin' ya big hoser?
Lucy says I have to help you, %s. Let's get goin'.
Yer still a hoser! Now it's choppin' time!
You're growin' on me, %s. Like a fungus.
Trees made into... paper? How unholy!
Hey %s, can't we all just get a-log?
I better not see anymore fires, little buddy.
%s! Hi little buddy!
We better get you a heart, hey kiddo?
Luce gave me the go-ahead! You're in trouble now, %s!
You're an alright spider, kiddo.
The skull gives me the willies, too.
%s, I can't believe what I just SAW! Wait, no...
Should you be setting fires, little buddy?
%s! Hi little buddy!
With a heart you'll be tip-top in no time, %s.
Hereeee's Woodie!
%s! You're doin' great, little buddy.
%s could learn some manners...
Keep those flames away from my trees!
%s! How ya doin', buddy?
First we'll get you a heart, then we'll get you some bacon, eh %s?
You're MIME now, %s!
%s, you're an alright guy.
Better than some of the things I've eaten!
Damp.
Doesn't look useful, but I could be wrong.
I hope that doesn't end up hurtin' any lil critters.
%s should read an etiquette book once in awhile.
Careful around those open flames, Ma'am.
%s. Ma'am.
You know where I can get a heart, %s?
This is gonna be a clear cut!
That's some good work ya did, Ma'am.
You're tempting a forest fire, %s...
Business as usual, I see.
Look who it is! %s!
Just don't haunt anything while I look for a heart, %s.
Here comes the wildfire!
You're on fire today, %s. No... actually.
You haven't been very gentlemanly lately, %s.
Was that blaze some sort of experiment, %s?
%s! Hey buddy!
Someone should rub a heart on %s.
Enemy of the forest!
%s, you're an alright guy.
It's a nice toque, eh?
The ones from home don't burn.
We can build these half as tall back home.
It's a gingerbread lumberjack.
Always had a soft spot for a good holiday cookie.
Satisfies the sweet tooth.
That thing just ain't right.
All the taste and none of the splinters!
Hard to complain about this whole \"Feast\" business.
Doesn't fall far from the cider tree.
Perfect for drinking next to a good fire, eh?
Psst, Lucy. Do I have a 'nog moustache?
For hanging on the unchopped tree with care.
Y'know, I do believe that was worth it.
What do you think, Lucy? Decorate, or chop?
Such senseless violence.
Too bad. Made the place feel real cozy.
Must... not chop...
All holidays should revolve around trees.
Too bad. Made the place feel real cozy.
I'm sure I have an extra pine cone somewhere.
%s could be a bit more considerate...
Don't singe your moustache, %s.
That's my buddy, %s! Hey!
C'mon, bud, let's get you on your feet.
You'll not strong arm me, %s!
%s has a big, squishy heart under those muscles.
%s isn't a true Canadian...
Been there, bud.
You're gonna have one monster headache after this, buddy.
Those fires are kind of counterproductive now, eh?
%s! Fancy seeing another Canadian here.
Canadians gotta stick together, %s. Let's get a heart.
Hey, c'mere %s! I've gotta AXE you question!
%s is a Canadian patriot, eh.
Be wary of the moving ground.
I know a plant when I see one. This's an impostor!
WOOORM!
That looks like a bum!
I'm not sure I want to look at that, eh?
It smells a bit off, eh?
This thing will be useful.
Wrinklier than the underside of a beaver.
%s is cruisin' for a bruisin'...
You're gonna singe your chassis, %s.
It's my metal buddy, %s!
Huh, I guess %s had a soul after all.
It's time to power DOWN, %s!
%s, you're an alright sort.
I could cut wood at night with this.
I can see the stars in it.
It's rude to stare.
Useful in a pinch!
What's that, eh?
It's aboot to go up in flames, eh?
It's too dark, eh!
You can taste the beak, eh?

It's covered in a peaceful moss.
It reads \"I've made a grave error.\" Hm.
The headstone is blank.
It reads \"I can dig it.\" Oh.
It reads \"Care to join me?\"
It reads \"Don't worry, it's cozy.\" That's nice.
\"And don't come back.\"
The inscription reads \"Always Watching\". Odd.
\"Milk. Eggs. Bacon.\"
Huh? That's my name!
It reads \"You're standing on my face.\" Oops.

Are you okay?
Chewing some wood will help you focus.
You alright, big guy?
What's wrong?
Are you sure you're feeling alright?
You're looking extra gruff today.
You look distracted.
Why are you making that face?
Try to take deep breaths, okay?
Calm down! Maybe you need to chew on a twig or something.
No! Don't chop any more!
Stop chopping, I'm getting nervous!
Slow down, I'm worried about you!
Watch out! You're going to turn!
The transformation is starting!
One more chop and you're in trouble!
You're overdoing it!
You're not pacing yourself!
You're about to change!
Take it easy!
Ease up, you're looking a little bucktoothed!
You've gotta slow down!
Hello? Can you hear me?
Isn't it about time for a nice wood snack?
Woodie! Remember to eat your twigs!
You might want to eat a log.
Mmm, bark... doesn't that sound good right now? Hm?
Have you been putting off your wood meals again?
Hey, hey, have a woodchip.
You know what happens if you don't eat enough wood!
That was a close one!
I think we'll be alright.
You're looking much better now.
It's passed. For now.
I was silly to doubt you.
Wow, I was afraid you were in for it!
I think the colour's returning to your cheeks.
It's back in the lodge. Phew!
Let's chop some trees!
Chop chop chop. Heh.
Chop, c-c-chop!
So, stone trees... what's up with that?
Let's find a small grove and just go nuts!
Nice day for a walk!
We make a good team!
There must be some trees around here somewhere.
This is perfect chopping weather.
A perfect day for some chopping.
You've got chops, buddy.
Hey! Chop some trees!
All work and no play makes me want to chop some trees.
It's dark in here!
I can't see anything!
This is honestly the worst.
I hate it in here.
What did I ever do to you?
I'm scared!
Help! Get me out!
There's nothing to chop in here!
This sucks.
Getttt meeee outttt!
I'm claustrophobic!
I have a fear of tight spaces!
I can't breathe! Wait.
Woooooo!
Woo-hoohoo!
RAAAA!
Die! Die!
Chop! Chop!
Destruction!
CHOP!
This is AWESOME!
Death to all trees!
Again! Let's chop another!
Nice swing!
Yeah!
Too easy!
Stupid tree!
Nom nom nom!
We did it!
I feel ALIVE!
HaHAHA!
YEEEESS!
This is what I live for!
You'll come back, right?
Aren't we friends?
Who chucks a talking axe?!
I... don't understand!
Can we talk about this?
Don't forget about me!
Oof!
I don't like where this is going.
Are... are you gonna make like a tree?
Ouch!
What did I say?
Oh, that's low.
Don't leave! I... I think I smell roses!
I know this is only temporary...
Awww...
Oh, is that how it is?!
Hey! I'd never throw you away!
Why would you throw me away?
Come back! Take we with you!
Hey! Get back over here!
I can't chop trees by myself!
So... lonely...
I guess I'll just stay here then...
What if I get stolen?!
Where did you go?
Take me with you!
It's cold!
I'm getting dirty!
There's monsters around you know!
I resent that!
You're abandoning me?!
But... but we're inseparable!
Ouch, that hurts.
What did I ever do to you!?
You're the ghostest with the mostest!
Don't take it out on me just 'cause you're dead!
If you were corporeal I'd chop you!
OOooOOooOOoo! Haha, just kidding.
Creepy!
Brrr! You're cold!
You got ectoplasm on my handle!!
Knock it off!
Rude!
ooOOoooOO to you too.
I am an axe possessed!
Pick on someone your own size!
Hey!
Jeez! Did I anger you in a past life?
I'm white as a sheet.
You're looking boo-tiful today.
Now I'm a HAUNTED axe.
I'm not scared of you, ghost!
Boo who?
I've seen scarier.
You think I'm afraid of you?
Do you worst, ghost.
Go bother someBODY else! Haha.
I missed you so much!
Did you miss me?
Together again!
Ahhh, I'm back where I belong.
It feels so good to be reunited!
I was afraid you'd never come back.
You came back for me!
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh, it was awful!
Never do that again! My little heart can't take it.
From now on we'll be inseparable.
You two-timer!
She's an impostor!
It's like you don't even know me!
Get rid of her! It's freaking me out.
I'm having an identity crisis over here.
Oh, you're just AXING for trouble!
You can't have two Lucys!
You can't have him! He's mine!
But I'M your one and only Lucy!
There can be only one!
How dare you do this to me!
You're replacing me?!
That's not me!
Betrayal!
Ooo I'll remember that!
Hey! Can't you tell us apart?
I don't know you.
Get your mitts off me!
Drop me this instant!
How dare you pick me up?!
Yuck, your hands are greasy!
Let me go!
Help! I'm being kidnapped.
Stranger danger!
Put me down!
Hey! Fresh!
Gross.
Excuse you!
Ummmm, EXCUSE me??
Leave me alone, you brute!
Put me down! You smell!
Did I say you could take me?
Oh no!
You have to fight it!
No! Fight it!
You've gotta resist!
It happened again!
The curse!
Not again!
You don't have to do this!
I warned you!
You're back!
You look much better.
Phew! That was scary!
I'm glad it's over...
Let's not do that again.
Remember your breathing exercises!
Everything is going to be fine. Just focus!
Are you okay?
That was a rough one, huh?
Don't let that happen again!
You scared me!
I think that creepy girl is mad at you.
I'm so glad you're alright!
Whew! Still in one piece?
It's good to have you back, buddy.

an explorer
???
Oh, you found my portal did you?
Hmm. Let's try something a little more challenging, shall we?
You'd think you would have learned your lesson by now.
Well would you look at that, you survived.
One down, four to go!
What? You're still here?
Impressive. But you should probably stop while you're ahead.
Say, pal.
Turn back now, or I may have to resort to drastic measures.
You're really pushing your luck.
You insolent, pitiful, insignificant ant!
You will regret coming any further...
Do not arouse the wrath of the Great Maxwell!
Where would be the sport in that?
Who do you think allowed you to make that?
Is this what you were expecting?
Just dust. And the void. And Them.
I've learned so much since then. I've built so much.
But even a King is bound to the board.
You can't change the rules of the game.
I don't know what they want. They... they just watch.
Unless you get too close. Then...
Well, there's a reason I stay so dapper.
What year is it out there? Time moves differently here.
Go on, stay a while. Keep us company.
Or put the key in the box. It's your decision.
Forgive me if I don't get up.
Either way, you're just delaying the inevitable.
Reality is like that, sometimes.
I think I've said enough.
...
You've been an interesting plaything, but I've grown tired of this game.
Or maybe They've grown tired of me.
Heh. Took them long enough.
They'll show you terrible, beautiful things.
It will change you, like it did me.
It's best not to fight it.
There wasn't much here when I showed up.
Well, this is it.
Don't you think I've tried that?
This is the end of the line. We have no escape.
You found me. Now, what are you going to do?
All I want in return is a truce.
Say, pal.
I'll give you food, gold, pigs, whatever you need.
Let's make a deal. You can stay here. Settle down, even.
The throne won't allow that. I've tried.
Is this how it ends?
Ah, I am a fool. I had dared to hope.
Thank you. I have been listening to that song for an eternity.
I guess I deserve that.
Fine. Just remember that you chose this.
It's just that...
I've become accustomed to winning.
We're not so different, you and I.
Oh, did you think you were the first?
HA!
That's why I brought you here.
That's why I brought all of them here.
Say pal, you don't look so good.
You'd better find something to eat before night comes!

The history of an ancient people is locked away inside.

We will celebrate as if we were in Valhalla!
I just need to find my beautiful assistant.
Naughty. Definitely naughty.
Say, pal, I don't look so good.
The poor unsuspecting fool has no idea what's coming.
Raaar! ...That's our bat noise.
We like parties!
Come closer - we are hungry!
I want to go home, but we can't find the way.
I'll only go to the party if Abigail comes too.
So alluring...
Shadows are as black as ink, or night, or nightmares.
I carry on for Abigail's sake.
Even I let my hair down occasionally.
All it takes is a spark of genius.
Knowledge is power!
I hope I don't break my glasses.
Woah, I'm smokin'! (No, really!)
He died before getting to see these beautiful flames.
Shadows are just inverted flames.
Surviving just requires strength of will. (And fire.)
I hate parties.
I'm sure I had a scientific reason for this.
Mwahahaha!
There is a scientific solution, here. I know it.
I used my special moustache wax.
Do not challenge the Mighty Wolfgang!
Wolfgang is tough. Lots of muscle.
Wolfgang is large moustache man! Ha ha!
I clean up pretty good, eh?
Forests are full of shadows, eh?
I could do with a haircut and a cup of tea, eh?
To chop the tree, you must be the tree.
I POLISHED MY CHASSIS FOR THE OCCASION
OVERCHARGED, READY TO CHARGE
NOW THE OUTSIDE MATCHES THE INSIDE. EVIL.
RUSTED AND BUSTED.
Smoldering
Stack
A pity.
You will not suffer.
It must be this way.
My world... threadbare.
My city... in tatters...
This will be quick.
How we've fallen.
Fools!
Who are you?
Release me, shade!
You are not Them...
Are you so easily deceived? Ha...
You deserve this.
You've made your choice.
Please...
You will fall as we did.
This is for the best.
You will be unraveled.
They are coming. It cannot be stopped.
This world's fabric is frayed and torn.
They are unfathomable.
I will save you.
I will stop this.
You cannot win.
Lend me your power, one last time.
You cannot hurt me.
Protect me.
You have been betrayed.
I must do this. For your sake.
Be woven.
How long have I slumbered?
Let the fuel take shape.
I will not be defeated so easily.
I will make you understand.
Let us end it.
You will rip apart at the seams.
I will save us.
Curse Their name!
It cannot end like this.
I was wrong.
Return them to me!
Why?

Set Intention
This server is the perfect arena for a fair fight. Everyone needs a place to prove who's the best at surviving, fighting, building, or... whatever.
Surviving's more fun when you do it as a team. On this server we want to work together and do our best to tame the hostile world.
Anything goes on this server! Forests will be burned, food will be nommed, and backs will be unceremoniously stabbed. Be prepared!
This server is a place for friendly chatter, a relaxed playstyle, and getting to know people. Everyone's welcome here!
Server Playstyle:
What's your server's playstyle?
You have to specify the Steam Group you belong to! Please verify the group number.
Bad Group ID
You forgot to choose a playstyle for your server!
Missing Server Intention
We recommend trying the game alone in a private world while you learn the ropes and get the hang of not starving. But it's totally up to you!

You're, like, laidback and flexible, man. Any world is good with you.
You'll show your opponents exactly what you're made of by playing smarter, harder, faster and coming out on top!
Teamwork is your guiding principal. It's not enough to just not starve, you have to not starve... Together!
Who knows what'll happen next? Mass fighting, crazy dance parties, pits filled with carnivorous spiders... it's pure madness!
You want to hang out, make friends, and play for fun. You don't care so much if you win or lose, as long as everyone's having a good time!

Help a poor old trader out with a few more  items and I'll give ya a higher quality item in exchange. Guaranteed.
I'm gonna need a few more  items to make a trade. I gotta cover my overhead, ya know? But ya'll get a better item in exchange.
Tha's it, fill the machine on up with  items and ya'll get a higher quality item back out.
Tha's tha ticket. Just bang a few more a those  items in tha machine to get a better item!
Ya got the rest of tha stuff I'm lookin' for? If not, come back in a few days an' there might be a new deal.
I just need tha rest of the items on tha list. Bang 'em on in tha machine an' it'll spit out a higher quality item for ya.
Pleased ta meecha.
Pleasure doin' business with ya.
Ya may not feel young, but I've been tradin' longer than ya been around, young pup.
I've always been a loner, me. Tha boss mostly lets me alone, which suits me fine.
Take yer time. I can stand here yammerin' all day.
My wagon's pulled by a nox. 'Es a good 'un, but 'e can't hold a candle to my old mule, Shadow.
Once, when I was but a young shaver... ah, but ya don' wanna listen to an old trader's stories.
What's a nox? Well, I don't know as I can rightly describe it. It's kinda like an ox, but not.
Ya can bang on that joystick all ya want but it won't do ya no good.
Don't ya go breakin' tha joystick, now. Ya don' need it anyhow.
Up, down, left, right, tha joystick don' do nothin'.
Here ya go, one very fine !
Look a' that, ya won a . C'mon back anytime, now.
There ya go, ya got this here .
Hey, ya struck it rich! Look at that . Ya must be extra lucky today.
Here ya go, one bran' new . Jus' remember I can't afford to give ya items this good all tha time.
Well, I guess me & tha machine are feelin' gen'rous today. Ya won a !
Ain't that just the koalefant's toenails! Ya got one very purty .
If ya give me tha items on tha list, I'll give ya a higher quality item in exchange.
Take a look at tha list. Get me all tha things on it and I'll give ya a better item.
Ya got tha items on tha list? Stick 'em in there and ya'll get a better item out 'o tha machine.
These're my special deals. Gimme the stuff I'm looking for and I'll give ya a better item in exchange.
I'm lookin' for some particular things right now. If ya can give 'em to me, I'll give ya a new one of higher quality.
The special deals are cheaper than tha normal ones, but ya gotta give me the exact things I'm lookin' for.
Ya got a heap 'o items? Want better items? Well, ya come to tha right place! Put 'em in that thar machine!
Got too many items? I can help ya with that problem! Stick 'em in my machine an' trade 'em for somethin' better!
Lookin' for new items? Trade in some old items and get a bran' new one of higher quality!
Lookin' to trade? Ya come to the right place. Put your items in tha machine to get somethin' better!
C'mon back when ya got something ta trade!
Sorry, but I can't give ya something for nothing, ya know.
If ya find any items while you're adventuring around out there, ya can bring the ones ya don't need ta me.
It'll be here in a jiffy.
I bet ya can't wait to see what comes out!
It should be here real soon now.
All right, kid. Give tha button a push to getcher item!
Just push tha button to start tha trade!
If ya wanna make tha trade, just push tha green button.
Slow down there, greenhorn. Are ya sure ya wanna gimme your last one 'o those? Ya won't be able ta use it anymore if ya do.
Wait jest a tick there. Tha's your last one o' those things. Ya won't be able to use it anymore if ya trade it away.
